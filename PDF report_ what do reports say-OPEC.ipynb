pandemic. It would see countries enter into renewed \\nlockdowns, with further humanitarian and economic repercussions.\\nIt was a period of continuing massive uncertainty, and for oil, and energy markets, it would require \\na renewed focus on \\nbalancing supply and demand and reestablishing \\nsustainable stability, such as through the \\nDeclaration of Cooperation (DoC).As we headed into \\n2021, beyond the benefits of the \\nDoC™s production adjustments in bringing down \\ninventory levels, the market was also buoyed by the \\nrollout of vaccines\\n and further global fiscal stimulus. While this year has not been without its challenges, we have not revisited the roller\\n-coaster ride of \\n2020. We are optimistic about the path ahead, although it is vital we see further \\ninternational commit\\n-ments to \\nsupport developing countries in acquiring sufficient vaccines, and thus improve the \\nchances for a \\ndurable and inclusive recovery.The WOO 2021, now in its \\n15th edition, takes on board the \\nshifting dynamics of the past year, par\\n-ticularly those presented by the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Our excellent researchers and analysts have \\nproduced a thorough and \\ncomprehensive publication that examines the future prospects for the \\nglobal economy, energy and oil demand, supply, refining and oil trade, as well as other drivers, \\nsuch as policies, technologies and sustainable development concerns.Moreover, it also explores a \\nnumber of sensitivities that may shift the outlook in different direc\\n-tions in the years and decades to come.\\nWhat is clear in this year™s \\nWOO is that energy and oil demand have picked up significantly in 2021, after the massive drop in \\n2020, and continued expansion is forecast for the longer-term. \\nGlobal primary energy demand is expected to increase by \\n28% in the period between \\n2020 and \\n2045, with all energies required, driven by an expected \\ndoubling in size of the global economy \\nand the addition of around \\n1.7 billion people worldwide by \\n2045. All energies witness growth, \\nwith the exception of coal. \\nRenewables see the largest growth, followed by \\ngas, but oil is still \\nexpected to retain its \\nnumber one position in the energy mix.To meet this demand requires \\nhuge investments. It is clear that underinvestment remains one of \\nthe great challenges for the oil industry and this was exacerbated by the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Over \\nthe course of \\n2020, investments \\ndeclined by around \\n30%. Without the necessary investments, \\nthere is the potential for further \\nvolatility and a future energy shortfall, which is \\nnot in the inter-ests of either producers or consumers.OPEC Member Countries remain committed to \\nsupporting investments, which benefit from sus\\n-tainable \\nmarket stability and the right enabling environment. This is a \\ncore focus of the DoC. In the lead up to \\nNovember™s COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, held under the presidency of the \\nUnited Kingdom, the WOO also examines \\nclimate and environmental policies\\n and the issues surround\\n-ing the energy transition. It is clear that the challenge of \\ntackling emissions has many paths and we need to explore them all; we need to look for \\ncleaner and more efficient technological solu\\n-tions across all available energies.\\nDirectly linked to the energy transition is \\nenergy poverty, which has been further exacerbated by \\nthe knock-on impacts of COVID-19. We need to keep in mind that \\nSustainable Development Goal number seven of the \\nUnited Nations (UN) focuses on ensuring access to \\naffordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all people. 2Mohammad Sanusi BarkindoSecretary General\\nThe core elements of the \\nUN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), particularly \\nequity, historical responsibility and national circumstances\\n, must be considered at all junctures \\nmoving forward.\\nOnce again, this year™s \\nWOO is an informative and indispensable reference tool for all energy \\nstakeholders, further underscoring the Organization™s commitment to \\nimpartial analysis, data transparency, and to the enhancement of \\ndialogue and cooperation. This can be viewed in the \\nvaluable contribution of our key energy dialogue partner, \\nIndia, in Chapter 9.I would like to personally thank the hard work, drive and steadfastness of the \\nOPEC Secretariat staff that have been involved in producing the \\nWOO. For the second year it has not been an easy \\ntask, given the restrictions on office-based working, but I salute each and every one of you for your \\ndedication and commitment to delivering this \\nflagship annual publication.As we have reached the end of \\nOPEC™s 60th Anniversary\\n year, the \\nWOO 2021 is a fitting bookend, \\nonce again highlighting \\nOPEC™s unshakable focus on evolving a better understanding of our \\n possible energy futures, and the challenges and opportunities we all face. \\n34Executive Summary\\n52020Œ20262026Œ20352035Œ20452020Œ2045OECD2.61.71.61.8Non-OECD4.84.03.43.9World\\n3.83.12.73.1Source: OPEC.\\nLong-term annual real GDP growth rates\\n % p.a.The World Oil Outlook (WOO) presents \\nOPEC™s medium- to long-term analysis and projections for \\nthe global economy, oil and energy demand, liquids supply and oil refining, as well as related \\npolicy and technology matters. This includes analysis of the energy industry™s various linkages and \\nits shifting dynamics. The detailed review in this Outlook includes breakdowns by region, sector and \\ntimeframe. The forecast period in this \\n15th edition of the Outlook extends to \\n2045 and the short-term outlook is consistent with the \\nJuly 2021 edition of OPEC™s Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR). Signs of strong economic recovery are evident\\nWhile the first signs of a strong economic recovery from the COVID-19-induced crisis are evi\\n-dent in quarterly growth rates, declining unemployment, business optimism and stock market \\nvaluations, there is also enormous potential for a huge rebound to follow as pent-up demand is \\nsatisfied, aided by the lasting effect of huge stimulus and infrastructure packages. On the other \\nhand, worries persist about the pace and trajectory of this recovery, the spread of COVID-19 vari\\n-ants, rising inflation, and how to unwind the massive quantitative easing programmes launched \\nby many central banks that have helped to underpin the rebound. \\nOPEC and countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) \\n continue efforts to stabilize oil markets\\nOPEC, together with other countries participating in the DoC, having proved its value in helping \\nstabilize the market in unprecedented circumstances during the pandemic and its fall-out, have \\nextended the decision of the 10th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (April 2020) until the \\nend of 2022.The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the global economy in multiple ways\\nThe impact of the pandemic and the response mechanisms that have been developed, will have \\na considerable impact on medium-term economic growth. It is too early to judge the full conse\\n-quences, but some trends and dynamics can already be discerned. \\nAn important trend that began beforehand, but was accentuated during the pandemic is the move \\ntowards a more localized and less intertwined global economy. Another important consequence of \\nthe pandemic has been rapidly rising global debt levels. Fiscal and monetary stimulus including \\nguarantees account for around $24 trillion. The challenges related to escalating debt levels have \\nbecome an increasing concern, particularly given the active talk around inflation in 2021 and the \\npotential for rising future interest rates and tax levels. Adding to this is the drop-off in travel and \\ntourism and how long this continues, as well as the potential for improving productivity from the \\npandemic-induced drive towards digitalization and artificial intelligence (AI).\\nGDP growth is projected to average 3.1% p.a. over the forecast period (2020Œ\\n2045), slowing from 3.8% p.a. in the medium-term to 2.7% p.a. from 2035Œ2045\\nAfter the 2021 recovery, with gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast at 5.5%, it is expected \\nthat growth will slow to around 4% in 2022 and then move back to levels slightly above 3%. It is then \\nanticipated to move slightly higher to reach 3.2% at the end of the medium-term period in 2026. \\nIn OECD economies, growth is forecast to materialize more at the beginning of the medium-term \\n6Source: OPEC.\\nDistribution of the global economy in 2020 and 2045\\n %Figure 1.8\\nmboe/dOECD AmericasOECD EuropeOECD Asia OceaniaChinaOther AsiaIndiaRest of the WorldOECDNon-OECD162013195723181110147181920452020period due to pent-up demand and the massive fiscal stimulus to counter the impacts of the pan\\n-demic. The medium-term growth outlook in developing countries is anticipated to be relatively \\ndiverse with the highest growth rates projected for India and China.\\nGlobal GDP growth between 2020 and 2045 is expected to increase at an average rate of 3.1% \\nper annum (p.a.) Global growth through to 2045 will be largely driven by non-OECD countries. \\nThese are expected to expand by 3.9% p.a. on average, on the back of improving labour produc\\n-tivity and a growing working age population, even as the pace of GDP growth begins to slow in \\nthe long-term.\\nThe global economy in 2045 will be more than double the size it was in 2020\\nBased on 2017 purchasing power parity (2017 PPP), global GDP is projected to rise from around \\n$125 trillion in 2020 to almost $270 trillion in 2045. China and India combined are expected \\nto account for 37% of global GDP in 2045. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \\nDevelopment (OECD) is set to account for slightly less, at 34%.\\nSignificant demographic shifts will accompany future population growth\\nThe global population is expected to reach 9.5 billion people by 2045. Future demographic trends are \\nmarked by an ageing population, a rising working-age population and increases in urbanization and \\nmigration rates. The global working-age population (15Œ64) is projected to rise by around 900 mil\\n-lion throughout the projection period, driven by non-OECD countries. However, the relative share of \\nthe global working-age population to the world™s total population is anticipated to drop from 65% in \\n2019 to 63% in 2045. By 2045, approximately 66% of the world™s population is projected to be urban\\n-ized. The OECD is projected to experience a rise in its net migration rate of approximately 4.7% by \\n2045, whereas the developing world is projected to undergo an outflow of population.\\nRecent changes in energy policies focus on accelerating energy transition\\nThere is growing awareness among policymakers in many countries that there is a need to accel\\n-erate actions to address climate change, which have recently resulted in ambitious new policy \\nintentions to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Several major countries and regions Œ includ\\n-ing the European Union (EU), the United States (US), Japan, the United Kingdom (UK), Canada \\nand Brazil Œ have proposed roadmaps to meet these goals, with China targeting carbon-neutral \\ngrowth by 2060.\\n7Total primary energy demand per region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/dGrowth\\nmboe/dGrowth\\n% p.a.Share\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045OECD\\n101.5\\n107.9\\n107.0\\n105.3\\n103.4\\n102.1\\n0.60.0\\n36.9\\n29.0\\nNon-OECD\\n173.9\\n195.7\\n212.3\\n227.0\\n240.9\\n249.9\\n76.0\\n1.5\\n63.1\\n71.0\\nWorld\\n275.4\\n303.6\\n319.3\\n332.3\\n344.3\\n352.0\\n76.6\\n1.0\\n100.0\\n100.0\\nAt the same time, there is increased public acceptance of products and services with a lower envi\\n-ronmental footprint, and a state of technology development that offers solutions Œ even if they \\ncome at a higher cost. These trends are being observed at a time when the post-COVID-19 recov\\n-ery plans in some major economies provide significant sources of funding that could accelerate \\nthe energy transition.\\nGlobal energy demand is set to increase from 275.4 mboe/d in 2020 to \\n 352 mboe/d by 2045Non-OECD primary energy demand is expected to constitute well over 70% of global primary \\nenergy demand in the long-term, growing from 174 million barrels of oil equivalent a day (mboe/d) \\nin 2020 to 250 mboe/d in 2045. This growth is mainly attributable to increasing populations and \\ngrowing economies in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\\nFor the OECD region, energy demand is set to flatten in the long-term. This underscores a further \\ndecoupling from economic growth due to structural changes and a policy push that continues to \\nplace increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and the deployment of low-carbon energy technol\\n-ogies. After a partial recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, energy demand in the \\nregion is set to peak in the medium-term before declining to around 102 mboe/d by 2045, reach\\n-ing a level similar to that seen in 2020.\\nOil is forecast to remain the fuel with the largest share of the global energy \\nmix until 2045 Primary oil demand is set to increase in the long-term from 82.5 mboe/d in 2020 to 99 mboe/d in \\n2045. Despite decelerating oil demand growth in the second part of the forecast period and strong \\ngrowth in other energy sources, such as other renewables, gas and nuclear, oil is expected to \\nretain the highest share in the global energy mix during the entire period. In 2020, oil accounted \\nfor 30% of global energy requirements. Alongside post-pandemic oil demand recovery, the share \\nof oil is anticipated to gradually increase to a level of more than 31% by 2025, before it begins a \\ndecline and reach 28% by 2045.\\n‚Other renewables™ and natural gas are projected to contribute most to future \\nincremental energy demand\\nDemand for other renewables is projected to expand from 6.8 mboe/d in 2020 to 36.6 mboe/d in \\n2045, representing the single-largest incremental contribution to the future energy mix. Moreover, \\nit is also the fastest-growing energy source with its share in the global primary energy mix above \\n10% in 2045, up from just 2.5% in 2020. This is driven by falling costs and policies focused on \\nreducing emissions.\\n8Gas demand is expected to increase by 21.6 mboe/d between 2020 and 2045. This brings total gas \\ndemand to 85.7 mboe/d in 2045, thus becoming the second-largest fuel in the energy mix. \\nMore stringent policies are set to reduce coal demand by almost 12 mboe/d dur\\n-ing the forecast period\\nMedium- to long-term coal demand is forecast to drop meaningfully across all OECD regions. This \\nis most dramatic in OECD Europe, where it falls by 5.5% p.a. over the forecast period. China™s coal \\ndemand is expected to slow to a plateau in the medium-term and then see a significant drop in the \\nlonger-term. At the global level, demand for coal is set to decline by almost 12 mboe/d, primarily \\ndue to measures targeting emissions reduction.\\nOil demand is projected to reach a level of 104.4 mb/d by 2026\\nThe global oil demand increase over the medium-term period (2020Œ2026) is estimated at 13.8 \\nmillion barrels a day (mb/d). However, almost 80% of this incremental demand will material\\n-ize within the first three years (2021Œ2023), primarily as part of the recovery process from the \\nCOVID-19 crisis. OECD oil demand is expected to increase by almost 4 mb/d in the period to 2026. \\nHowever, all of this increase will not be sufficient to return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels. Non-\\nOECD demand is anticipated to increase by almost 10 mb/d over the medium-term, with around \\nhalf of this increase needed to offset the demand decline in 2020. \\nGlobal oil demand is expected to increase by 17.6 mb/d between 2020 and \\n2045Global oil demand is forecast to rise by 17.6 mb/d between 2020 and 2045, growing from 90.6 \\nmb/d in 2020 to 108.2 mb/d in 2045. Long-term projections highlight a contrasting demand picture \\nbetween continued growing demand in the non-OECD and declining demand in the OECD. This \\ntrend is set to start already in the medium-term, before intensifying over the long-term. OECD \\noil demand is projected to peak at levels around 46.6 mb/d in 2023, before it starts a longer-term \\ndecline towards a level of 34 mb/d by 2045.\\nIn contrast, oil demand is set to continue to grow in the non-OECD region. Driven by an expanding \\nmiddle class, high population growth rates and stronger economic growth potential, oil demand \\nin this group of countries is expected to increase by 25.5 mb/d between 2020 and 2045, reaching \\na level of 74.1 mb/d in 2045. \\nWorld primary energy demand by fuel type, 2020Œ2045\\nLevels\\nmboe/dGrowth\\nmboe/dGrowth\\n% p.a.Fuel share\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045Oil\\n82.5\\n94.5\\n97.3\\n98.6\\n98.9\\n99.0\\n16.5\\n0.7\\n30.0\\n28.1\\nCoal\\n72.9\\n74.4\\n71.7\\n67.9\\n64.4\\n61.3\\nŒ11.7\\nŒ0.7\\n26.5\\n17.4\\nGas\\n64.2\\n69.8\\n74.8\\n79.5\\n83.2\\n85.7\\n21.6\\n1.2\\n23.3\\n24.4\\nNuclear\\n14.3\\n16.0\\n17.5\\n19.0\\n20.7\\n22.0\\n7.6\\n1.7\\n5.2\\n6.2\\nHydro \\n7.5\\n8.2\\n8.9\\n9.5\\n10.2\\n10.5\\n3.0\\n1.4\\n2.7\\n3.0\\nBiomass\\n27.2\\n29.4\\n31.7\\n33.8\\n35.7\\n37.0\\n9.7\\n1.2\\n9.9\\n10.5\\nOther renewables\\n6.8\\n11.3\\n17.4\\n24.0\\n31.2\\n36.6\\n29.8\\n7.0\\n2.5\\n10.4\\nTotal\\n275.4\\n303.6\\n319.3\\n332.3\\n344.3\\n352.0\\n76.6\\n1.0\\n100.0\\n100.0\\nSource: OPEC.\\n92019202020252030203520402045Growth\\n2020Œ2045OECD\\n47.7\\n42.1\\n46.3\\n44.0\\n40.8\\n37.3\\n34.2\\nŒ7.9\\nNon-OECD\\n52.3\\n48.6\\n57.3\\n62.6\\n67.1\\n70.8\\n74.1\\n25.5\\nWorld\\n100.0 \\n90.6 \\n103.6 \\n106.6 \\n107.9 \\n108.1 \\n108.2 \\n17.6 Oil demand in the Reference Case, 2019Œ2045\\n mb/dSource: OPEC.\\nGlobal oil demand set to plateau during the second half of the outlook \\nperiod \\nProjections highlight the front-loaded pattern for future demand growth.

The \\nFigure 6.4\\nmboe/dAsia-PacificMiddle EastRussia & CaspianEuropeAfricaLatin AmericaUS & Canada0510152025303540452019202020252030203520402045mb/d 15world is still short of achieving universal energy access. Eradication of energy poverty should, \\ntherefore, remain an overarching goal for resilient and sustainable development. International \\ncooperation and solidarity are more important than ever. The central principle of the 2030 Agenda \\nŒ to leave no one behind Œ must be kept at the heart of efforts toward achieving all SDGs. \\nUncertainties on future economic development, energy policies and technology \\nhave widened the range of possible oil demand and supply trajectories\\nDevelopments during the past year have made it clear that there are a number of uncertainties \\nrelated to the main factors affecting future oil demand. In respect to the global economy, the risk \\nfor oil demand over the medium-term is skewed to the downside and primarily related to a poten\\n-tially extended pandemic situation. In the long-term, the risk is rather symmetric with each path \\ndeviating from the Reference Case by more than 6 mb/d at the end of the forecast period.\\nThe faster implementation of more stringent policies and penetration of energy efficient technol\\n-ogies could reduce future oil demand by more than 8 mb/d in 2045, compared to the Reference \\nCase. Oil demand in the road transportation sector alone could be reduced by some 3 mb/d in \\n2045.With regard to non-OPEC supply, different assumptions for investment, project timing, policies \\nand technology are modelled in Lower and Higher Supply Cases, with risks heavily skewed to the \\ndownside. In the Lower Case, US tight oil declines gradually until a modest rebound is seen in \\nthe latter part of the 2020s, although it never again reaches pre-pandemic levels. This opens up a \\npotential downside of nearly 4 mb/d at peak. In other non-OPEC countries, project cancellations, \\nlower investment and to some extent policy measures curb as much as 3 mb/d in the long-term. \\nThe Higher Supply Case projects a US tight oil production upside of around 1 mb/d, while output \\nin other non-OPEC countries adds 2.5 mb/d in the long-term.\\n16Introduction\\n17INTReflecting back on 2021, and to the WOO 2020 published one year ago, it is clear that many uncer\\n-tainties still abound. This past year has seen the global rollout of a suite of COVID-19 vaccines, \\nalbeit with an incomplete and highly divergent reach, and much remains to be done in this regard. \\nIt is almost certain that countries and regions will face further waves of rising cases, more lock\\n-downs and new measures to combat the pandemic Œ some of which may persist for quite a while \\nyet. However, the vaccine rollout does appear to mark the beginning of beating back the pandemic \\nand its fall-out. \\nWhile the first signs of a strong economic recovery are evident in quarterly growth rates, declin\\n-ing unemployment, business optimism and stock market valuations, there is also enormous \\npotential for a huge rebound to follow as pent-up demand is satisfied, aided by the lasting effect \\nof huge stimulus and infrastructure packages. On the other hand, worries persist about the \\npace and trajectory of this recovery, rising inflation, and how to unwind the massive quantita\\n-tive easing (QE) programmes launched by many central banks that have helped to underpin the \\nrebound.\\n Beyond the short- to medium-term, it remains to be seen whether some of the behavioural \\nchanges witnessed during the long lockdowns persist. Question marks abound over where and \\nhow we will live and work, and how this will change patterns of commuting, travel and consump\\n-tion. Technology in its widest sense remains a wildcard, with extended lockdowns having made it \\nclear to many just how dependent we are on it, but also how enabling it can be. \\nIn the longer-term, minds are increasingly focusing on the need to address climate change. One \\nof the Biden administration™s first acts was to re-join the Paris Agreement. All G7 countries now \\nhave plans to significantly reduce emissions, and to reach ‚net-zero™ by 2050. China meanwhile \\nhas pledged to have emissions peak before 2030 and attain ‚carbon-neutral growth™ by 2060. In \\nJuly 2021, the EU Commission spelled out details of an ambitious proposal to reduce emissions \\nby 55% by 2030 (from 1990 levels) in the ‚Fit for 55™ package, which could, if implemented, bring \\nforward the end of new ICE vehicle sales in the EU. The car manufacturing sector in many cases \\nalready appears to be gearing up towards a significant shift to EV sales, investing billions in driv\\n-etrain and battery technology. In the EU, a recent surge in EV sales is striking, in the face of overall \\nlower car registrations in 2020.\\nOPEC and its Member Countries inherently support ambitions to decarbonize the energy mix, but \\nit should be noted that the analysis underpinning this Outlook suggests there are still consider\\n-able doubts as to whether all these ambitious climate-mitigation commitments will be met in the \\nproposed timeframe. For example, the EU Commission™s ‚Fit for 55™ plan remains exactly that for \\nthe time being, a plan, which still needs to be negotiated and agreed by all EU Member States, \\nleaving ample scope for exceptions and watering-down. \\nAs such, and given developmental needs, this Outlook projects that oil will remain an important \\npart of the mix for years to come, still making up 28% of the global energy mix in the Reference \\nCase by 2045. This is based upon a return to pre-pandemic economic and oil demand levels during \\n2021Œ2022, and steady economic growth thereafter. Nonetheless, renewable energy sources will \\nbe the fastest-growing source of energy and will represent a vitally important part of the energy \\nmix by 2045.On the supply side, the DoC, having proved its value in helping stabilize the market in unprece\\n-dented circumstances during the pandemic and its fall-out, saw participants extend the decision \\nof the 10th OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting (April 2020) until the end of 2022. While non-\\nOPEC supply is set to recover, and meet much of the demand for new oil in the medium-term and \\nbeyond, in the long-term, the burden is expected to be on OPEC Members to provide much of the \\noil to meet the world™s needs. \\n18This Outlook reviews and analyzes all these connected trends and shows detailed results for the \\nfuture energy mix, as well as an in-depth look at oil demand, supply, downstream and trade. \\nFor the first time ever, it features a whole chapter dedicated to the outlook for India, the country \\nlikely to be key in driving long-term energy needs. Lastly, given as always, the large innate degree \\nof uncertainty when making long-term projections, this year™s WOO examines a number of oil \\ndemand and supply sensitivities.\\n1920Key assumptions\\n21Ł The global population is expected to increase by around 1.7 billion, from around 7.8 \\n billion in 2020 to 9.5 billion by 2045.\\nŁ Non-OECD population growth is much higher than that of the OECD, driven by the Middle \\nEast & Africa, with Other Asia, India and OPEC following. \\nŁ The COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately influence the demographics of many countries. It \\nis already becoming apparent that it has influenced birth rates across the world.\\nŁ The working-age population (15Œ64) is projected to rise globally by 932 million over the \\nprojection period. The relative share of the global working-age population is anticipated \\nto drop from 65% in 2020 to 63% in 2045. \\nŁ The global urbanization rate is forecast to rise from 56% in 2020 to approximately 66% \\nby 2045. Ł Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures, global GDP fell \\nby 3.4% in 2020. Ł A recovery in GDP growth will take place in 2021 with a forecast of 5.5%, before settling \\nat 3.2% by the end of the medium-term period in 2026.\\nŁ In the long-term, global GDP growth is set to decelerate to an annual rate of 2.7% \\nbetween 2035 and 2045. \\nŁ Based on 2017 PPP, global GDP is projected to rise from around $125 trillion in 2020 to \\nmore than $270 trillion in 2045.\\nŁ China and India alone are forecast to account for more than a third of global GDP in 2045, \\nwhereas the OECD will account for slightly less at 34%. \\nŁ This Outlook takes into account currently enacted energy policies while also recognizing \\ntheir evolving nature.\\nŁ Policy instruments that primarily target objectives of the Paris Agreement will con\\n-tinue to drive a transition to renewable energy sources and a reduction in greenhouse \\ngas (GHG) emissions. Nevertheless, energy-related policies differ among countries and \\nrespond to changing conditions. \\nŁ Both current and future technologies will play a significant role in shaping the future \\nenergy landscape. The development, and implementation, of multi-faceted technologies \\ncontributes to helping set the scene for the Reference Case. \\nŁ Hydrogen is considered in the context of the energy transition as a solution to some of \\nthe challenges.\\n22To establish a WOO Reference Case a number of key assumptions must be made and in this \\nfirst chapter these are highlighted and analyzed. This includes fundamental population and \\n demographic trends shaping the world; forecasts for economic growth and the global recovery \\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic; and energy policies and technology that are expected to have an \\nimpact on the energy sector. \\n1.1 Population and demographics\\nWhile the world™s population is expanding gradually, the average age of the population is \\n rising significantly. With regional variations in the overall trend, different countries are at \\n different phases of a transition to low population growth. Many OECD countries already have \\nlow population growth, and many developing countries are likely to transition in the com\\n-ing decades. Being an essential input to the WOO analysis, demographic elements consist\\n-ing of population growth rates, working populations, urbanization, and immigration have been \\n thoroughly examined.\\nDerived from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division \\nprojection (UNDESA, 2019), an approximate increase of 1.7 billion is expected in the projected \\nglobal population by 2045. This leads to a total global population of close to 9.5 billion by 2045, \\ncompared to the 2020 level of around 7.8 billion (Table 1.1), the same level as reported in the \\nWOO 2020.\\nSource: United Nations (UN).\\nTable 1.1\\nPopulation by region\\nLevels\\nGrowth\\n2020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD America\\n520\\n537\\n554\\n570\\n583\\n594\\n74OECD Europe\\n580\\n584\\n587\\n588\\n589\\n587\\n7OECD Asia Oceania\\n217\\n217\\n215\\n213\\n210\\n207\\nŒ9OECD\\n1,317\\n1,338\\n1,356\\n1,371\\n1,382\\n1,388\\n72Latin America\\n474\\n493\\n509\\n523\\n534\\n542\\n67Middle East & Africa\\n1,118\\n1,259\\n1,406\\n1,559\\n1,718\\n1,881\\n762\\nIndia\\n1,380\\n1,445\\n1,504\\n1,554\\n1,593\\n1,621\\n241\\nChina\\n1,439\\n1,458\\n1,464\\n1,461\\n1,449\\n1,429\\nŒ10\\nOther Asia\\n1,218\\n1,289\\n1,352\\n1,408\\n1,456\\n1,496\\n278\\nOPEC\\n501\\n554\\n609664\\n720\\n778\\n278\\nRussia\\n146\\n145\\n143\\n141\\n139\\n137\\nŒ9Other Eurasia\\n198\\n201\\n203\\n204\\n205\\n206\\n8Non-OECD\\n6,475\\n7,190\\n6,915\\n7,513\\n7,814\\n8,091\\n1,615\\nWorld\\n7,792\\n8,181\\n8,545\\n8,885\\n9,196\\n9,479\\n1,687\\nmillions\\n23When compared to the OECD region, the population growth projection of the non-OECD region is \\nnoticeably disproportionate, accounting for over 95% of the growth. As per OPEC™s regional group\\n-ings (see Annex B), a significant portion of the population growth will be driven by the Middle East \\n& Africa region (excluding OPEC countries) at approximately 45%. Other Asia, India and OPEC will \\ncontribute approximately between 14% and 17% of the growth. It is forecast that 72 million peo\\n-ple will be added to the OECD region by 2045, mainly in OECD Americas, with approximately 4% \\nof the global growth. \\nCompared to population growth of 198 million in the past 25 years (1995Œ2020), China™s \\n population is now projected to decline by ten million over the next 25 years (2020Œ2045). \\nThis is the biggest slowdown in growth among emerging economies. India is projected to see \\nits population expand by 240 million over the period 2020Œ2045. This is significantly lower \\nthan the 416 million added over the previous 25 years. For the OECD, its expected population \\ngrowth for 2020Œ2045 is much lower than the 198 million expansion in its population in the \\n1995Œ2020 timeframe. \\nThe Middle East & Africa region (excluding OPEC) is currently experiencing a swift rate of \\n population growth, with this trend expected to remain even towards the end of the projection \\nperiod. The region sees the largest expansion over the period, and by 2045 will be the leading \\nregion by overall population. Notably, Middle East & Africa and OPEC are the only regions expected \\nto increase their growth rate, adding 762 and 278 million people in the period between 2020Œ2045, \\n respectively, compared to the 518 million and 214 million added from 1995Œ2020.\\nIndia™s population is forecast to exceed that of China in the second half of the 2020s (Figure 1.2), \\nbut it is then expected to be surpassed itself by the Middle East & Africa around 2035.\\nFigure 1.1\\nWorld population growth, 1995Œ2020 \\nversus\\n 2020Œ2045Source: UN, OPEC.\\nFigure 1.1\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nOPECOther AsiaLatin AmericaRest of the WorldChinaIndiaMiddle East & AfricaOECDŒ1004009001,4001,9002,4001995Œ20202020Œ2045millions24Figure 1.2\\nWorld population trends, 1990Œ2045\\nSource: UN, OPEC.\\nFigure 1.2\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n05001,0001,5002,000199019952000200520102015202020252030203520402045millionsOECDLatin AmericaMiddle East & AfricaIndiaChinaOther AsiaOPECRest of the World1.1.1 COVID-19 impact on birth-rates\\nThe impact of COVID-19 is not only limited to the direct effects of the virus or the economic \\n consequences related to lockdown measures and restrictions on movement. While it may take \\nmany years to be seen and even longer for the impacts to be felt, the pandemic will ultimately \\ninfluence the demographics of many countries and it is already becoming apparent that the \\n pandemic has influenced birth rates across the world. \\nEarly in the pandemic, reports in the US were already predicting fewer births in 2020 and provi\\n-sional data from the US Government highlights a drop of 4% from the number of births in 2019, \\nthe lowest level in decades. The EU and Japan have also reported a drop off in birth rates when \\ncompared to rates prior to the pandemic. However, some countries have registered expecta\\n-tions for an increase in births during the pandemic. \\nA drop in the birth rate following a major economic or related crisis is not unusual as parents may \\ndelay or avoid making decisions on having children given the uncertain environment. For those \\ncountries that are already experiencing fewer than 2.1 children born per woman Œ a figure that is \\nwidely used as the birth rate required to maintain a population™s size Œ this could be a further con\\n-cern. For example, the EU™s birth rate was only 1.53 in 2019. Further birth rate drops for regions \\nlike the EU would create more challenges given the prospect of dealing with an increasingly aging \\npopulation. It could even potentially influence immigration levels as countries look to fill gaps in \\ntheir working age populations.\\n1.1.2 Working-age population\\nThe global working-age population (15Œ64) is projected to rise by approximately 932 million \\nthroughout the projection period (Table 1.2). The relative share of the global working-age popula\\n-tion to the world™s total is anticipated to drop from 65% in 2020 to 63% in 2045. Regardless of the \\noften diverse trends, the decline is perceived across all regions. \\n25Table 1.2\\nWorking population (age 15Œ64) by region\\n202020252030203520402045Growth\\n2020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n341\\n348\\n353\\n359\\n365\\n371\\n30OECD Europe\\n374\\n370\\n364\\n357\\n349\\n342\\nŒ33\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n136\\n133\\n130\\n125\\n118\\n113\\nŒ23\\nOECD\\n851\\n851\\n847\\n841\\n833\\n826Œ25\\nLatin America\\n319\\n331\\n339\\n347\\n351\\n351\\n32Middle East & Africa\\n636\\n730833\\n943\\n1,056\\n1,170\\n535\\nIndia\\n928\\n986\\n1,029\\n1,064\\n1,091\\n1,108\\n179\\nChina\\n1,012\\n1,007\\n986\\n943\\n898\\n871\\nŒ141\\nOther Asia\\n805\\n854\\n897\\n934\\n964\\n986\\n181\\nOPEC\\n301\\n336\\n374\\n412\\n448\\n483\\n182\\nRussia\\n9793909089\\n86Œ11\\nOther Eurasia\\n130\\n131\\n132\\n133\\n133\\n132\\n1NonŒOECD\\n4,229\\n4,466\\n4,682\\n4,866\\n4,997\\n5,187\\n958\\nWorld\\n5,081\\n5,317\\n5,528\\n5,706\\n5,862\\n6,013\\n932\\nmillions\\nSource: UN.\\nChina™s working-age population is expected to decline by 141 million over the forecast period. \\nThis corresponds with China™s expected population growth dynamics. Compared to 2020, and with \\napproximately 535 million additional working age people by 2045, the Middle East & Africa is pro\\n-jected to undergo the highest growth, followed by OPEC, Other Asia, and India, all three with an \\nexpansion of around 180 million. Notably, the Middle East & Africa (including OPEC) will add more \\nthan three-quarters of the world™s working-age population by 2045.\\n1.1.3 UrbanizationUrbanization trends are essential as these have significant implications on economic devel\\n-opment, social issues and energy consumption. Besides, urbanization is closely associated to \\nimproved energy access and is an essential factor for mitigating energy poverty. Urbanization in \\nthe Outlook is expressed in terms of the urban rate, which measures the level of the total popu\\n-lation living in urban areas in percentage terms. In 1950, 30% of the world™s population resided in \\nurban areas, but in 2020 more people, now over 56%, live in urban areas than in rural areas. By \\n2045, approximately 66% of the world™s population is projected to be urban. \\nThe Latin America and OECD regions are evidently the most urbanized with, on average, more than \\n80% living in urban areas (Figure 1.3). Currently, the most urbanized regions are Latin America \\n(with 83% of its population living in urban areas in 2020), OECD Americas (82%), OECD Europe \\n(77%) and OECD Asia Oceania (87%). \\nChina has experienced a dramatic change in urbanization. The country™s urban population \\nrate was as low as India™s before 1990, but since then it has experienced significant growth. \\nMoreover, it is expected to grow further, despite the decelerating rate, to reach close to the \\nglobal average in 2045. This has helped to drive the current overall urbanization level in Asia \\nto almost 50%.\\n26Remarkably, India™s urbanization rate has been the lowest, and regardless of the considerable rise \\nin the coming decades, it is expected to still remain the lowest regionally in 2045. The Other Asia \\nregion is expected to broadly follow the trajectory of India in terms of urbanization levels through \\nto 2045, but it starts from a higher base. \\nOPEC Member Countries stand at a level above the current global average of around 65%. The \\nMiddle East & Africa region is expected to undergo a substantial development in urbanization lev\\n-els in the coming decades, but Africa is anticipated to remain mostly rural with 43% of its popula\\n-tion living in urban areas by 2045.\\n1.1.4 Migration\\nAnother vital element of demographic variations on a regional basis is the movement of popula\\n-tion. Net migration as depicted in Table 1.3 (measured as the variation of population between the \\nmedium variant case and zero migration variant case) shows that population inflows are mainly \\nto OECD regions and, to a much lesser extent, Russia. The OECD is projected to experience a rise \\nin its migration rate by 2045 of approximately 4.7%, whereas the developing world is projected to \\nundergo an outflow of population.\\nCOVID-19 impact on migration\\nIn 2020, according to a report by UNDESA, the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impacted all \\nforms of mobility. Global lockdown measures, including border closures, disrupted international \\ntravel, which significantly impacted international migration. The report highlighted that ﬁhun\\n-dreds of thousands of migrants were stranded, unable to return to their countries, while others \\nwere forced to return to their home countries earlier than plannedﬂ.\\nAlthough it could be considered too early to correlate the impact of the pandemic on migration \\ntrends, the UNDESA report suggests that the number of international migrants declined by ﬁtwo \\nFigure 1.3\\nUrbanization rate for selected regions, 2000Œ2045\\nSource: UN, OPEC.\\nFigure 1.3\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nOECD25354555657585952000200520102015202020252030203520402045%OECDNon-OECDLatin AmericaMiddle East & AfricaIndiaChinaOther AsiaOPECWorld27Table 1.3\\nNet migration by region in the medium variant\\n% of regional population\\n20252030203520402045OECD Americas\\n1.02.23.65.06.5OECD Europe\\n0.40.91.62.43.3OECD Asia Oceania\\n0.61.22.02.83.7OECD0.71.52.53.64.7Latin America\\nŒ0.4Œ0.7Œ0.9Œ1.1Œ1.3Middle East & Africa\\n0.0Œ0.1Œ0.3Œ0.4Œ0.5IndiaŒ0.2Œ0.3Œ0.5Œ0.7Œ0.9ChinaŒ0.1Œ0.3Œ0.4Œ0.6Œ0.7Other AsiaŒ0.3Œ0.7Œ1.1Œ1.5Œ1.8OPEC0.30.40.30.20.1Russia\\n0.30.71.21.72.2Other Eurasia\\nŒ0.3Œ0.5Œ0.8Œ1.1Œ1.3NonŒOECDŒ0.3Œ0.6Œ0.9Œ1.3Œ1.2Source: UN, OPEC.\\nmillion globally by mid-2020ﬂ. This reduction is equivalent to ﬁ27% in the growth expected from \\nJuly 2019 to June 2020ﬂ (UNDESA, 2020).\\n1.2 Economic growth\\nIt is essential to note that all GDP related numbers, estimates and forecasts for regional aggrega\\n-tions were shifted from the 2011 PPP base to 2017 PPP levels, as published by the World Bank™s \\nInternational Comparison Programme (ICP) and applied by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \\nConsequently, data history has been recalculated and historic comparisons are now also based on \\nthis new measurement. The 2017 PPP-based GDPs are used as weights to compute regional and \\nglobal real GDP growth.\\n1.2.1 Current situation and short-term growth\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic constitutes a momentous event for the global economy. The pandemic \\novershadowed most of 2020 and its huge impacts have continued into 2021. Moreover, it will very \\nlikely have significant medium- to long-term consequences for the global economy. \\nIt is already obvious that there is a pre-pandemic and a post-pandemic world. The post-pandemic \\nchanges to the global economy may be manifold and while some of these trends were already \\nseen pre-COVID-19, a number have been accelerated by it, and others have originated from the \\npandemic. For the short-term, it is important to note that there were massive dislocations that may only see \\na levelling off in the medium- to long-term. The most obvious developments in 2020 were:\\nŁ A sudden and extreme drop off in economic activity, particularly in 2Q20; \\nŁ This drop-off had severe ripple effects, such as on global goods inventories. For exam\\n-ple, supply shortages and disruptions were witnessed in semiconductors, as well as other \\n28vital goods. This has had an impact on economic developments in 2021, and this will likely \\n continue into 2022;\\nŁ The contact-intensive services sector almost came to a halt at the global level following \\nthe onset of the pandemic. Impairments in this sector are forecast to continue in the short-\\nterm and it is likely that the sectors of travel and tourism, hospitality and leisure will only \\nmove back to their 2019 levels in 2023, or even 2024; \\nŁ The services sector activity saw a significant sub-sectorial shift towards IT, communica\\n-tion, health and financial services;\\nŁ Contrary to the contact-intensive services sector, manufacturing picked up quickly in 2H20, \\nleading the rebound. Industrial output recovered quickly too; and\\nŁ For the oil market, the severe effects on travel and transportation led to a strong decline in \\noil demand, and revenues in the sector. This not only impacted oil-producing economies, \\nbut the global economy too.\\nThe developments and impacts on the oil market at the onset of the pandemic ultimately led to 20 \\nApril 2020, when the US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price turned negative for the first time. \\nIt was a visceral moment for the oil market, and the broader global economy. \\nAfter a sharp contraction of the global economy in 1H20, unprecedented monetary and fiscal \\nmeasures across the globe helped support a recovery in 2H20, a momentum that has been car\\n-ried over into 2021. In 2Q20, OPEC and its non-OPEC partners in the DoC also initiated the larg\\n-est, and for the longest period, production adjustments in the history of the oil industry. This \\nwas focused on rebalancing fundamentals, and helping return a sustainable stability. Moreover, \\nit also provided support to the global economic recovery.\\nThis was a sign not only of the commitment, motivation and dedication of OPEC and the DoC part\\n-ners in attending to the short-term, but in focusing on the medium- and long-term too. The efforts \\nwere also recognized by the G20, who expressed their commitment to energy market stability. \\nThese multilateral-led efforts led to an oil market recovery in 2H20 and 2021, again supporting \\nglobal economic growth. \\nAfter the sharp economic decline in 1H20, the global economy recovered swiftly in 2H20, fueled by \\nthe large government-led stimulus measures, the OPEC-led rebalancing of the oil market, the use \\nof consumer savings from the 1H20 lock-down periods, and a consequently well-funded cycle of \\npent-up demand. However, despite the strong rebound in 2H20, the drop in GDP growth for 2020 \\nstood at 3.4%.\\n1.2.2 Stimulus efforts\\nFiscal and monetary support measures across the globe in 2020 were massive and accounted for \\nmore than 20% of global GDP. They have been a key support factor in the swift recovery.\\nAmong the support measures, monetary easing added around $8 trillion (Figure 1.4) to the bal\\n-ance sheets of the G3 central banks, the US Federal Reserve System (Fed), the European Central \\nBank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). These accommodative policies are forecast to potentially \\ncontinue for some time, but it is clear it is also dependent on inflationary developments and the \\ndangers of overheating.\\nThe US has led the way, with a massive fiscal drive that will likely have medium- and long-term \\nrelated growth impacts. Former US President, Donald Trump, signed a $2 trillion stimulus pack\\n-age, named the ‚Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act™ into law in March \\n2020. Other measures followed, including Congress passing a $900 billion relief bill in December \\n2020. 29In March 2021, the new US President, Joe Biden, signed into law the ‚American Rescue Plan Act of \\n2021™, which amounted to further stimulus of $1.9 trillion. This new package amounts to almost \\n9% of GDP, but not all the money will end up in GDP-enhancing activity, as up to $500 billion is \\nestimated to cover lost revenues, the repayment of debt, as well as for precautionary savings or \\nfor subsidizing certain areas of the economy. These areas include state and local government sup\\n-port, education support, small business relief, as well as other business support in the leisure and \\nagriculture sectors. \\nBy applying a high fiscal multiplier of around 0.7 to the remaining GDP-enhancing $1.4 billion of \\nfiscal stimulus from the plan, the net GDP support in 2021 would stand at around five percentage \\npoints (pp) of GDP. The $900 billion package from the end of last year is forecast to support the \\neconomy by around 2.5 pp this year too. The new US stimulus support has come at the same time \\nas a strong drive by the newly elected US administration to vaccinate the US population. This led \\nto a strong 1H21 rebound in US growth.\\nWhile the US was successful in its early immunization programme, the EU and Japan still faced \\nCOVID-19 related challenges and lockdowns in the early parts of 2021, delaying the recovery \\ntowards the end of 2Q21 and in to 2H21, although the EU™s vaccinations efforts have picked up sig\\n-nificantly since the 2Q21. \\nHowever, both the EU and Japan have also initiated large stimulus packages to support their \\neconomies. The EU issued a fiscal stimulus package of •750 billion, called the Next Generation \\nEU (NGEU) fund for supporting growth in 2021 and beyond. The NGEU consist of two facilities, \\none facility covers grants at a magnitude of •390 billion and the second facility provide loans at \\na magnitude of •360 billion. The exact allocation of the funds remains to be seen, but high-debt \\ncountries that have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, such as Italy and Spain, will be \\nthe largest recipients. Japan saw a fresh economic stimulus package of $708 billion in December \\n2020 to speed up the recovery from the country™s deep pandemic-driven slump, while targeting \\ninvestment in new growth areas such as green and digital innovation.\\nFigure 1.4\\nG3 central banks™ balance sheet assets \\nSource: Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Haver Analytics, OPEC.\\nFigure 1.5 \\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n4,1665,5005,4507,1468,0006,6507,7818,9356,8603,5004,5005,5006,5007,5008,5009,500FedECBBoJ$ billionDec 2019Oct 2020Apr 2021301.2.3 Recovery in 2021\\nThe OECD GDP contracted by 4.7% in 2020, but in 2021 OECD growth is forecast to recover to 4.9%, \\nsupported, in particular, by growth expectations for OECD Americas, while the Euro-zone and \\nJapan are facing a delayed recovery due to the lockdowns in 1H21. In the emerging economies, \\nIndia™s growth forecast for 2021 stands at 9.5%, taking into consideration some negative 1H21 \\nimpacts from the ongoing COVID-19 challenges in the country. \\nIt should be noted that with the changes from the ICP™s 2017 PPP adjustments, the weight of OECD \\neconomies was lifted by around 3%. Consequently, non-OECD economies were lowered by the \\nsame magnitude. Given the shift of the base year and the ICP™s consideration of inflation, the PPP-\\nadjusted global GDP increased in the new base year of 2017 from $113 trillion to $122 trillion, with \\na consequent effect on the whole time-series.\\nIn emerging and developing economies, most key economies continue to face challenges related \\nto the pandemic, the exception so far being China, although it is obviously still impacted by the \\nglobal situation. India, in particular, faced a strong wave of COVID-19 infections in 2Q21, leading \\nto a considerable decline in 2Q21 growth. Brazil and Russia have recovered slowly in 2021, albeit \\nbenefitting from the rebalancing of commodity markets, especially the oil market, a development \\nthat was, however, counterbalanced by the ongoing COVID-19 related developments in these two \\neconomies. Contrary to the ongoing challenging pandemic situation in most emerging and devel\\n-oping economies, China has up to now successfully contained widespread outbreaks of COVID-19 \\nand posted a strong rebound after its GDP plunged in 1Q20.\\nIndia™s 2020 GDP growth stood at a negative 7%. Following growth of 2.3% in 2020, China™s GDP \\ngrowth is forecast at 8.5% in 2021. Brazil™s GDP growth forecast for 2021 stands at 3.2%, follow\\n-ing a contraction of 4.1% in 2020. Russia™s GDP growth is forecast at 3%, after contracting by 3.1% \\nin 2020.It is clear that the US, given its strong rebound, and China are the countries currently driving the \\nrecovery. However, it is expected that the Euro-zone, the UK and Japan, among other OECD econ\\n-omies, as well as some emerging and developing economies, will join the momentum in 2H21, \\nleading to global growth of 5.5% in 2021.\\nImportantly, the underlying assumption for the strong 2H21 recovery is that COVID-19 will be \\nlargely contained towards the end of the year, in the sense that the majority of the population in \\nadvanced economies will be vaccinated and that the pandemic will not pose a major obstacle for \\nmajor emerging economies by then. In addition, forced private household savings during the lock\\n-downs are forecast to accelerate global economic growth in 2H21 via pent-up demand, especially \\nin the contact-intensive sectors. \\nHowever, there are still some significant uncertainties, particularly in terms of COVID-19. The path the \\npandemic takes will be the overarching factor impacting the short-term recovery, with the potential \\nemergence of new COVID-19 variants and/or mutations posing a particular risk. This can be viewed in \\nthe Delta variant that has become a dominant strain in a number of countries since May/June 2021.\\nMoreover, sovereign debt in most economies has risen to levels at which a lift in interest rates \\ncould cause severe fiscal strain. Global debt increased by $24 trillion in 2020 Œ more than the size \\nof annual US GDP Œ and it is forecast to rise further, based on data from the International Institute \\nof Finance (IIF). Global debt now stands at more than $280 trillion, or more than three times the \\nsize of annual global GDP based on market exchange rates (more than two times when based on \\nPPP), an unprecedented level. \\nWhile key interest rates are still low, and are assumed to stay at a very accommodative level in \\nthe near-term, inflation worries have come to the fore, fueling a debate if the low interest rate \\n31environment will have to end soon. It is still too early to conclusively define if rising inflation, \\nwith a particular focus on US developments, is indeed temporary, or more permanent, and \\nwhether it may become more global. Reopening effects and temporary supply shortages in \\nthe US have driven inflation levels higher. It also remains to be seen how the US labour mar\\n-ket will develop and if the improving economy will lead to wage-rises, again potentially lift\\n-ing inflation. Not only did global commodity prices rise as a key price component of the global \\neconomy, but as a consequence of the pandemic, semi-conductors have doubled in prices \\nover the last year and led to supply shortages in industrial production, leading to rising prices \\nfor a variety of goods. \\nAnother important point to emphasize is that global trade has recovered in 2021 (Figure 1.5), after \\nstrong declines during 1H20. There was a base effect, given the drops last year, but there is no \\ndoubt that the recovery in commodities trading, in combination with the effects of reopening and \\npent up demand, have played a role too. \\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 1.5\\nGlobal trade growth year-on-year\\nFigure 1.5\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nŒ20Œ16Œ12Œ8Œ40481216Jan 2017May 2017Sep 2017Jan 2018 May 2018 Sep 2018Jan 2019 May 2019Sep 2019 Jan 2020May 2020Sep 2020Jan 2021%Global trade volumeGlobal trade valueGlobal trade was already in decline pre-COVID 19. Global trade policies in the preceding years that \\nled to a more protectionist environment Œ at its core the US-China trade frictions, but also other \\nUS-centered trade related developments and Brexit Œ played a role in this trend. So, if adjusting for \\nthe strong decline in 2020, the uptick would naturally not have been that strong in volume or value \\nterms, but would have rather continued at a relatively low growth rate. With the ongoing trade and \\npolicy-related discussions between the US and China, and an ongoing trend towards more local\\n-ized and less globally intertwined supply chains, global trade developments, particularly in the \\nmerchandise goods sector, remain in a state of flux. \\nOne important area to highlight is that despite some selective efforts to de-globalize, the US™s \\nglobal export share peaked at 14.7% in 2020, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade \\nand Development (UNCTAD), compared to 14% in 2019 and 12.9% in 2018. It remains on an upward \\ntrend. \\n321.2.4 Medium-term economic growth\\nThe impact of the pandemic, and the response mechanisms that have been developed, will have \\na considerable impact on medium-term growth. It is too early to judge the full consequences and \\nmagnitude of the pandemic on economies, but some trends and dynamics can already be garnered. \\nAn important trend that began before the pandemic was the move towards a more localized and \\nless connected global economy, driven by the US-China trade dispute and wider policy issues. \\nWhile the detailed outcome remains unclear, a less globalized world with more localized supply \\nchains seems likely to materialize. That is not only driven by politics, but also by security reasons \\nas the pandemic has laid bare the risks that are connected to global supply chains in the case that \\nthey become disrupted. \\nHowever, it is important to note that while external trading will likely become less global, it has, \\nin general, always been regionally dominated with three main large trading hubs. One is the \\nUS-centered trade region of the Americas, dominated by North America. Another is the Europe \\nregion, with its dominant force of Germany, and the third is the Asian region, centered on China. A \\npotential consequence of less globalized trading may also lead to regional inequalities as wealth \\ntransfers via an exports shift. \\nThese changes may take time to evolve, but in the medium-term at least they will possibly affect \\nthe trading of goods, while the global trading in services may in fact accelerate as an outcome of \\nthe pandemic. During the pandemic it became clear that specific services can be provided cross-\\nborder relatively easy via the tools that global digitalization advancements offers. That may also \\nlead to a more international labor market in which private and public entities are increasingly able \\nto source skill sets that are not bound to a certain location or a specific language internationally. \\nFor the medium-term forecast, it is assumed that the pre-pandemic low growth pattern of global \\ntrade will continue and that, importantly for the oil-sector, the recovery in travel and tourism Œ as \\na significant component in services trading Œ will only reach 2019 levels by around 2023 and 2024.\\nAs mentioned previously, another important consequence of the pandemic has been the rap\\n-idly rising global debt level. Fiscal and monetary stimulus, including guarantees, accounted for \\naround $24 trillion. In fact, the increase in global debt, incorporating sovereign and private sec\\n-tor debt, rose a similar amount of $24 trillion, based on data from the IIF. Global debt now stands \\nat more than three times the size of annual global GDP based on market exchange rates (more \\nthan two times when based on PPP) and is likely to rise more in the medium-term. This bears \\ntremendous risk, as any revenue shortfall, due to, for example, a slowing global economy, or any \\nmajor shift in interest rates, may cause considerable dislocations in the world economy. For the \\nmedium-term forecast it is assumed that no major debt issues arise and the debt servicing will \\nbe well-managed.\\nThe challenges of escalating debt levels have become an increasing concern, particularly given \\nthe active talk around inflation in 2021 and the potential for future interest rate rises. While infla\\n-tion has risen globally, it is US inflation that has been the major focus. It has not only moved sig\\n-nificantly above 2% (a level widely accepted to be healthy), but given that the US dollar is the global \\nreserve currency it has caused apprehension elsewhere. Although rising prices may to a large \\nextent be attributable to reopening effects and possibly temporary supply disruptions, underly\\n-ing forces, such as global wage pressure, could in the medium-term also lead to sustained higher \\nprices with the associated consequences. For the medium-term forecast, it is assumed that infla\\n-tion remains well-anchored and that the high 2021 levels will normalize and retract to around 2% \\nlevels over the medium-term.\\nIt should be noted, however, that it may be in the interest of economies to have slightly elevated \\ninflation levels, and at the same time low key interest rates, or negative real interest rates. This \\nmay be helpful in reducing the large debt that has accumulated. \\n33Another important factor that may play a role in reducing debt are rising tax levels. In times of \\nincreasing debt, taxes that commonly help to reduce debt include those on wealth, capital gains, \\nproperty/real-estate, inheritance, top-incomes and corporate taxes. Additionally, environmental \\ntaxes are very likely to play a key role in the coming years. Minimum global corporate taxes as \\nintroduced by the G7 in 2021, as well as through the US administration™s initiative of the ‚American \\nTax Plan™, point in this direction. Further tax plans, especially in advanced economies, are expected \\nto follow. For the medium-term forecast, it is assumed that rising taxes will not derail the global \\neconomic recovery and that they will be taken from well-established and well-cushioned sources \\nand that the effects of these taxes will turn out to be well-targeted. \\nA further result of the pandemic are expanding inequalities within economies and across \\nnations. The low-interest rate regime is clearly more beneficiary to the wealthier, for a vari\\n-ety of reasons. Moreover, among nations it is obvious that the global economic recovery has \\nbecome increasingly divergent. Those economies that are able to gradually contain the pan\\n-demic, thanks to vaccination campaigns and other successful containment strategies, and that \\nalso have the financial capabilities to provide economic stimulus measures, have rebounded \\nrelatively quicker. This is in contrast to those economies that have less access to vaccinations, \\napply less successful containment strategies and have only limited financial resources for fis\\n-cal and monetary stimulus. This may lead to a further rise in global inequality and potentially \\nto political frictions. For the medium-term forecast, it is assumed that there will be no further \\nconflict that may dampen the global economic recovery going forward and, generally, domestic \\ninequalities within economies will be successfully managed via redistribution effects or other \\npolicy measures. \\nA macro trend that began before the pandemic, and one that seems to have gained further trac\\n-tion on the back of it, is the momentum towards environmental, social and governance (ESG) poli\\n-cies in the global economy. This will likely impact the global economy in a variety of ways in the \\nmedium-term, and beyond. Investments will be channeled towards ESG-related areas and pos\\n-sibly the financing of non-ESG related investments could become more expensive. In general, it \\nis assumed in the forecast that this is a steady trend and, hence, will only have a gradual impact. \\nHowever, if the trend develops at a more rapid pace, it could lead to rising energy prices due to the \\npotential lack of investments in conventional fuels.\\nAnother impact of the pandemic has been the drop off in travel and tourism, with 2019 levels only \\nexpected to return by around 2023/2024. Looking ahead, non-essential business travel will likely \\nbe reduced, private travel curtailed for some time after the pandemic, and ESG-related develop\\n-ments will likely also impact this sector. Considering that travel and tourism accounts for more \\nthan 10% of global GDP, the effect will be felt continuously in the medium-term, particularly in \\nregions that have previously relied heavily on tourism. \\nAdditionally, the trend towards increasing home-working seems to be here to stay. The knock-on \\nimpact of this is less commuting with gradual impacts on both economic and social dimensions with  \\nmany areas impacted by these trends. For example, stationary retail sales in office areas will be less \\nfrequent, there will be slowing demand for office space, more meetings will be virtual and also crude \\noil-demand may be impacted, among others. \\nWhile emerging and developing economies are forecast to outgrow advanced economies in the \\nmedium-term, they will likely also face a decelerating growth momentum amid maturing domestic \\neconomies. In addition, a potentially lessening global trade dynamic may support this trend too. In par\\n-ticular, China and India, constituting the two largest emerging economies, are expected to follow this \\npattern and this is reflected in the medium-term forecast, as well as the long-term too.\\nAnother important topic related to the pandemic is that of productivity. On average, \\n productivity has slowed considerably in advanced economies over the last few decades and the \\n34forecast assumes that any productivity improvements will continue to be at low growth lev\\n-els. However, there is some potential upside. This may come from the pandemic induced drive \\ntowards digitalization and AI, although the effective utilization of these new technologies and \\n improvements in productivity may take some time to materialize.\\nReflecting in more detail on the forecast for medium-term GDP growth levels, it is important to \\nhighlight that the base assumption is that COVID-19 will not continue to materially impact global \\neconomic growth patterns. It is assumed that the pandemic will be widely contained. \\nAfter this year™s recovery with GDP growth forecast at 5.5%, it is expected that growth will stand \\nat around 4% in 2022. In 2023, the after-effects of the stimulus-induced effects will continue to be \\nfelt with growth standing at 3.5%, compared to the last year™s forecast of 3.2%, while the forecast \\nfor 2024 is unchanged at 3.3%. It is anticipated to be at a level of 3.2% in 2025 and 2026, as shown \\nin Table 1.4. \\nLast year™s WOO forecast saw growth reaching 3.4% at the end of the medium-term period (then \\nending in 2025).The 2025 forecast in this year™s Outlook is 0.2 pp lower, due to the front-loaded \\ngrowth levels in 2021 and 2022. It is obvious that post-pandemic growth patterns are widely dis\\n-torted due to the base effect from the 2020 pandemic-led recession, as well as the unprecedented \\nfiscal and monetary stimulus enacted to counterbalance it.\\nWhile growth seems to be well supported in the medium-term, numerous uncertainties remain. \\nEvidently, COVID-19 could cause further economic disruptions in the coming years if the virus is \\nnot contained effectively and sufficiently, but there is also the possible consequences of rising \\ndebt levels on both the sovereign and private household sides of the economy. It could lead to a \\nrising number of defaults and/or a larger-than-anticipated slowdown in consumption, and con\\n-sequently investment. Such a situation may arise if inflation remains at an elevated level for an \\nextended period, and interest rates rise in tandem.

Moreover, \\nthe trend towards a less globalized world and associated trade-related issues, as well as the pos\\n-sibility of re-emerging geopolitical issues and a continuation of social conflicts in numerous coun\\n-tries, need to be monitored closely. \\nMedium-term economic growth by region\\nIn OECD economies, growth is forecast to materialize more at the beginning of the medium-term \\ndue to pent-up demand and the massive fiscal stimulus to counter the impacts of the pandemic. \\nBy the end of the medium-term period, however, growth is forecast to have slowed considerably, \\nstanding at 1.7% in 2026. This compares to the forecast of 1.7% in last year™s WOO. \\nOECD Americas is expected to recover swiftly at the beginning of the medium-term period, with \\nthe US forecast to lead the growth momentum. After the massive decline in all economies of \\nOECD Americas in 2020, the major fiscal and monetary stimulus in the US, as well as in Canada, \\ncombined with COVID-19 containment strategies in 2021, are forecast to build a sound base for \\nmedium-term growth. This momentum going forward should build on a continued rebound in \\nlabour markets and a strong recovery in consumption and investments. \\nA recovery in global trade and a sound commodities sector, especially the oil market, will add fur\\n-ther support, including Mexico™s growth dynamic. Chile is also forecast to benefit from a general \\nrecovery in commodity exports, primarily its main export, copper. Further fiscal stimulus in the US \\nvia an infrastructure package and a family and social welfare package could add further support \\nto the region™s growth. On the flip side, the very high-debt level in the US, in combination with any \\nsustained high inflation level, could challenge the growth momentum.\\nOECD Europe is forecast to see less of a rebound compared to OECD Americas, but a positive \\nrecovery is expected. Supported by the stimulus measures of the European Commission, Member \\nStates and the ECB, the negative economic impact of COVID-19 is forecast to be overcome and \\ngrowth is expected to be relatively high at the beginning of the medium-term. In particular, this is \\ndriven by the major economies of Germany and France. This will also be accompanied by a general \\nrecovery in the global economy and an increase in global trade. Towards the end of the medium-\\nterm, growth tapers off, and by 2026 it is at 1.6%, below that of OECD Americas.\\nHowever, debt-related issues in some EU economies, particularly Italy, may re-emerge, although it \\nis anticipated that they will be well-contained. The forecast also assumes a gradual recovery in the \\ncar sector, which is particularly important to Germany, Spain and to some extent France and Italy. \\nThis will be of particular importance after the semi-conductor-related supply shortages in 2021.\\nIn OECD Asia Oceania, Japan is forecast to see decelerating growth in the medium-term, and \\nalongside the region™s major trading partner, China, will provide strong guidance for the region™s \\nfuture growth. While the Japanese government, together with the BoJ, introduced an enor\\n-mous stimulus programme in 2020, accounting for more than 20% of GDP, it is forecast that the \\nJapanese economy will move back to its low-growth pattern after the stimulus efforts taper off in \\nthe medium-term. Positively, the recovery in Japan™s large trading partners, China, as well as the \\nUS and the EU, will continue to support growth, especially at the beginning of the medium-term.\\nThe medium-term growth outlook in \\nnon-OECD countries will be relatively diverse. Growth levels \\nin Latin America, the Middle East & Africa and OPEC were all relatively limited in the years prior to \\nCOVID-19 and, hence, have a lower base level. With generally improving commodity markets, the \\nmain export focus for a large majority of the major economies in these regional groups, growth is \\nanticipated to recover from their low levels, especially after COVID-19, although some uncertain\\n-ties remain. High population growth in these economies will be beneficial too, especially in the \\nlonger-term. \\n36In Latin America, growth is forecast to be relatively equally distributed over the medium-term \\nperiod, although significant challenges related to COVID-19 remain. The region should mainly \\nbe supported by a continuation of growth in Brazil and a successful rebound in Argentina, antici\\n-pating that the country will effectively manage its current sovereign debt challenges. With the \\nexception of 2022, when growth is forecast to reach 2.7%, the dynamic is anticipated to remain at \\na rate of around 2.5%, due to the medium-term effects of the pandemic. Almost every country in \\nLatin America has been significantly affected by COVID-19 and growth levels remain constrained. \\nDespite the ongoing challenges, further upside may come from a continued strong commodity \\nmarket. Moreover, a successful outcome of further Brazilian structural reforms could additionally \\nadd to the growth momentum. \\nIn the Middle East & Africa, medium-term growth is expected to rise slightly. The region is forecast \\nto be a beneficiary of a rebound in the global economy and, hence, will be aided in the medium-\\nterm from rising demand for commodities and growing regional domestic demand fueled by the \\nexpansion of the middle class. A rebound in the global economy is forecast to lift foreign invest\\n-ment into the region too. China™s role as the region™s major foreign investor, and its need for natu\\n-ral resources, will continue to be extremely important.\\nHowever, some dampening effects may come from any slowdown in China, which may be a chal\\n-lenge for the region, while some countries™ high sovereign debt obligations and debt servicing may \\nbe another constraint. \\nAfter \\nChina had been impacted severely by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the country man\\n-aged a swift rebound, supported by government stimulus measures and its containment of COVID-\\n19. After high growth on the back of the stimulus-induced recovery in 2021, China is forecast to grow \\nat a slower rate as its economy matures. In 2022, the economy is forecast to grow by 6.3% and then \\ncontinue to drop over the medium-term to stand at 5.1% in 2026, albeit still a relatively high rate.\\nAn important element for China will be developments in its relations with the US, particularly \\ntrade-related negotiations and policy discussions. The agreement of the phase one trade deal with \\nthe US in 2020 was broadly welcomed, but it remains to be seen to what extent the deal will be ful\\n-filled and how the trade related challenges evolve further. The forecast assumes that no additional \\nfrictions in trade relations will materialize in the medium-term.\\nAdditionally, China™s shifting focus from external trade and investments towards a more domesti\\n-cally oriented one, led by private household consumption, will likely counterbalance some of the \\npotential shortfalls from external trade. An ongoing challenge will be to balance out the need for \\nan economic rebound and growing imbalances in the private sector, while at the same time reduc\\n-ing domestic debt levels.\\nIndia™s growth was significantly impaired in 2019, slowing to 4.9%, the lowest growth since the finan\\n-cial crisis of 2009. It was then even more impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when growth \\nfell by 7%. The country put together a large stimulus package in 2020, which filtered into 2021, how\\n-ever, the large wave of COVID-19 cases in 2Q21 dampened the recovery significantly. Despite this \\nnegative impact, the economy is forecast to grow by 9.5% in 2021, but is then expected to slow to 6.8% \\nin 2022. A gradual slowdown towards 2026 leads to growth of 6.2% at the end of the medium-term.\\nOther Asia is forecast to see healthy medium-term growth. Growth is forecast at 4.5% by the end \\nof the medium-term in 2026, unchanged from the previous year™s WOO, and with slightly rising \\nmomentum. Growth in 2022 is forecast at 4.4%. \\nOPEC, as a group, was already facing a challenging year in 2019, when GDP declined by more than \\n1%. The pandemic, therefore, hit already weakening economies and pushed the decline further \\nto reach a negative 5.2% in 2020. The recovery that is forecast in the medium-term period will be \\n37hugely supported by the efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC countries in the DoC to help rebalance \\nthe oil market. OPEC™s GDP growth is forecast to show a solid appreciation over the medium-term \\nperiod as a global economic recovery spurs oil demand. Growth at the end of the medium-term \\nperiod is forecast to be significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels, reaching 2.9% in 2026.\\nIn Eurasia, \\nRussia constitutes the most important economy followed by other key oil-producing \\ncountries. Producer nations that are participating in the DoC will benefit significantly from the \\noil market rebalancing witnessed in the 2H20 and into 2021, a very important element in leading \\nto expected stable medium-term growth. On the potential downside, Russia™s economy remains \\nhampered by sanctions. Russia™s GDP growth is forecast to decelerate slightly, driven in part by its \\ndeclining population and the resulting drop in consumer demand. Similarly, Other Eurasia is fore\\n-cast to slow towards the end of the medium-term.\\nEurasia is forecast to show growth of 1.9% in 2026, 0.8 pp below expected growth in 2022. Russia \\nis forecast to grow by 1.5% in 2026, 0.8 pp below the anticipated growth in 2022. Other Eurasia is \\nforecast to grow by 2.5% in 2026, also around 0.8 pp below estimated growth in 2022.\\nThese divergent trends in non-OECD countries are expected to lead the group to see growth of \\n4.4% in 2026, compared to 4.8% in 2022.\\n1.2.5 Long-term economic growth\\nAs in previous editions of the WOO, the assumptions underlying long-term economic growth \\ndevelopments are primarily based on productivity growth, demographic trends and labour market \\ndevelopments. Within this framework, labour productivity is by far the most important contribu\\n-tor, both at the regional and global level (Figure 1.6). As previously mentioned, further upside may \\ncome from the pandemic induced drive towards digitalization and AI and the more effective use of \\nthese evolving technologies.\\nFor non-OECD economies, the rise in the working age population will be another important ele\\n-ment for growth. A young and thriving population, in combination with advancing education will be \\nvital for future growth in less affluent parts of the global economy. In areas like the Middle East & \\nAfrica and OPEC, relatively lower labour productivity will continue to be counterbalanced by the \\nspillover into the labour market from rapidly expanding populations.\\nSeveral economic regions and individual economies will be affected by a decline in the working-\\nage population, especially OECD Europe and OECD Asia Oceania, but in Russia and China too. This \\ndynamic will limit these economies™ growth potential, even as labour productivity is forecast to \\nincrease.\\nGlobal GDP growth between 2020 and 2045 is expected to increase at an average rate of 3.1% p.a., \\nwhich is slightly above the assumption in the WOO 2020, when the growth forecast stood at 2.9%. \\nThis is partially due to the strong recovery at the beginning of the period with expansive govern\\n-mental-led stimulus lifting growth, and despite the fact that 2020 has been considerably impacted \\nby COVID-19.\\nGlobal growth through to 2045 will be largely driven by non-OECD countries, in line with assump\\n-tions from previous WOO editions. These countries are expected to grow by 3.9% p.a. on average \\n(Table 1.5), on the back of improving labour productivity and a growing working age population, \\neven as the pace of GDP growth begins to slow. The growth forecast for the whole forecasting \\nperiod is 0.2 pp above that of last year.\\nIndia is expected to remain the fastest growing major developing country with average growth of \\n6.2% p.a. After the considerable fiscal stimulus in 2020 and 2021, growth is even more front-loaded \\n38over the projection horizon. Moreover, it is supported, and in line, with expected demographic \\ngrowth trends. This compares to the long-term forecast in last year™s WOO of 5.6%, clearly an out\\n-come of the strong global recovery in 2021. Nevertheless, this is still slightly below the pre-pan\\n-demic WOO 2019 forecast, when India™s expected long-term growth average stood at 6.3%. \\nAs in previous WOO editions, China is expected to be the second fastest growing major economy, \\nwith average growth of 4% p.a. over the forecast period. This is slightly above the assumption in the \\nWOO 2020, when average growth stood at 3.9%. China™s growth pattern has been relatively stable \\nand is not expected to alter significantly in the long-term. It will, however, likely see slowing growth \\ntowards the end of the forecast period, also in line with its maturing economy and ageing population. \\nBetween 2035 and 2045 growth is at 2.8%, unchanged from last year™s WOO. \\nIn the last decade of the forecast period, China™s economic growth dynamic will thus be overtaken \\nby numerous single economies and economic regions, including India, the Middle East & Africa, \\nOPEC, as well as Other Asia. In these economies, an expanding working-age population will con\\n-tribute to faster economic growth compared to China™s ageing and gradually declining population.\\nEconomic growth in Other Asia is seen at 3.7% p.a. over the long-term. The momentum is forecast \\nto accelerate to 4% p.a. in the period from 2025Œ2035 and to then slow to 3% p.a. in the decade \\npreceding 2045. Nonetheless, this is still significantly above the global average of 2.7%.\\nIn the Middle East & Africa, growth is estimated to average 3.9% p.a., a slight upward revision \\nfrom last year. This region is forecast to benefit not only from a rising population, but also from \\nan increase in income as more people enter the middle class, which provides rising consumption \\ncapacity. This is forecast to come in combination with support from commodity markets amid the \\nglobal growth appreciation. Further upside may materialize if additional structural and economic \\nreforms take place in less productive economies.\\nIn Russia, unfavorable demographic changes and a reduction in the working-age population \\nmay be somewhat counterbalanced by labour productivity gains. Economic growth in Russia is \\nexpected to rise at 1.6% in the decade up to 2035, after a slightly higher medium-term growth \\nFigure 1.6\\nLong-term GDP growth rates by components, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 1.6\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nŒ1012345Non-OECDOECDWorld% p.a.Employment rateParticipation rateWorking-age populationLabour productivityGDP growth39Table 1.5\\nLong-term annual real GDP growth rate\\n% p.a.\\nSource: OPEC.\\n2020Œ20262026Œ20352035Œ20452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n2.9\\n2.0\\n2.0\\n2.3\\nOECD Europe\\n2.4\\n1.4\\n1.3\\n1.6\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n1.91.2\\n1.0\\n1.3\\nOECD\\n2.6\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.8\\nLatin America\\n2.7\\n2.4\\n1.92.3\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n3.2\\n3.9\\n4.4\\n3.9\\nIndia\\n6.9\\n6.3\\n5.5\\n6.2\\nChina\\n6.1\\n4.0\\n2.8\\n4.0\\nOther Asia\\n4.6\\n4.0\\n3.0\\n3.7\\nOPEC\\n2.7\\n3.1\\n3.2\\n3.0\\nRussia\\n2.0\\n1.6\\n1.3\\n1.6\\nOther Eurasia\\n2.9\\n2.5\\n2.0\\n2.4\\nNonŒOECD\\n4.8\\n4.0\\n3.4\\n3.9\\nWorld\\n3.8\\n3.1\\n2.7\\n3.1\\naverage of 2%. Developments in commodity markets, particularly, in crude oil markets will also \\nplay an important role in Russia™s growth path. However, the country™s declining population is \\nexpected to be the main influential force that prevents growth moving beyond the long-term aver\\n-age of around 1.6%. Elsewhere in Eurasia, marginal growth in the working-age population will \\nhelp maintain GDP growth at an average 2.4% p.a. over the forecast period.\\nLatin America is forecast to be impacted by a number of structural issues in the medium-term, \\nchallenges that may remain influential even beyond this period. The ongoing sovereign-debt chal\\n-lenges in Argentina and related issues will need close monitoring. Furthermore, the pace of struc\\n-tural reforms in Brazil, amid the ongoing domestic political and economic challenges will be of \\nkey interest. The forecast anticipates that the financial issues in Argentina will be overcome in the \\nmedium-term period. Moreover, gradual reforms in Brazil will help build a sound base for growth \\nabove the 2% level in the long-term across the region. As a result, Latin America will see relatively \\nhigher growth at the front-end of the curve, and overall it is expected to achieve a 2.3% p.a. growth \\nlevel over the forecasting period.\\nReviewing further details within the OECD region, economic growth is forecast to average 1.8% \\np.a. for the period from 2020Œ2045. Following the unprecedented US stimulus measures to coun\\n-terbalance the COVID-19 related impacts, OECD Americas is anticipated to continue to lead OECD \\ngrowth prospects with a stable long-term economic outlook at 2.3% p.a., a rise from last year™s \\nWOO 2020 assumption of 2%. Growth in the last decade of the forecasting period is expected to \\nremain at a strong 2% level. Immigration into the US, and to some extent Canada, will help expand \\nthe workforce, while labour productivity growth may provide further upside. \\nIn the other OECD regions, particularly OECD Asia Oceania, declining working-age popula\\n-tions will likely drive a deceleration in economic growth, down to 1% p.a. for the final years of \\n40the projection period. This compares to the total long-term average of 1.3% p.a. OECD Europe \\nis also forecast to decelerate, amid population and working-age declines, showing average \\ngrowth of 1.6%  p.a. in the long-term, but dropping to 1.3% for the final years of the forecast \\nperiod.The GDP growth figures assumed in this year™s WOO imply that the global economy in 2045 will be \\nmore than double the size it was in 2020 (Figure 1.7). Based on 2017 PPP, global GDP is projected \\nto rise from around $125 trillion in 2020 to almost $270 trillion in 2045.\\nFigure 1.7\\nSize of major economies, 2015Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 1.8 indicates that China and India alone will account for 37% of global GDP in 2045. The \\nOECD will account for slightly less at 34%. The largest GDP appreciations are set to come from \\nChina and India over the course of the forecasting period. China is expected to add $41.6 tril\\n-lion to global GDP and India $30.4 trillion. This compares to an addition of $32.6 trillion from \\nthe OECD.Despite large shifts at the regional level, the global economic picture does not see significant \\nchanges in the ranking of average income (measured as GDP per capita). OECD Americas is fore\\n-cast to remain the region with the highest GDP per capita, followed by OECD Asia Oceania and \\nOECD Europe. \\nThe regional grouping of Middle East & Africa is still expected to have the lowest GDP per cap\\n-ita, as shown in Figure 1.9. It is also set to be the only region where the average income is less \\nthan $10,000 (2017 PPP) in 2045. India and China are anticipated to see the biggest changes, with \\naverage income in China seen rising, closing some of the gap to OECD countries, and overtaking \\nRussia™s GDP per capita level. \\nThe global average income is projected to rise from $16,000 (2017 PPP) in 2020 to more than \\n$28,000 (2017 PPP) in 2045.

The potential effect of energy policies on the future energy \\nmix, either from those already in place or still in development, continue to garner momentum and \\nis the focus of many countries™ post-pandemic planning.\\n42Countries across the globe are striving to meet commitments to limit global warming as part of \\nthe Paris Agreement and are using national, regional and international policy mechanisms to \\nachieve their goals. Furthermore, as collectively commitments have so far been found to be insuf\\n-ficient to reach the long-term targets of the Paris Agreement, a significant effort is underway in \\nmany major countries to develop more stringent policies, which target the end of this decade, as \\nwell as mid-century. \\nThe overall result is that these policies become a driving force Œ with the potential to accelerate \\na change in the energy mix with the deployment of low- or zero-emission energy systems, or in \\ntheir support of the adoption of technologies that are utilized to reduce emissions. The formula\\n-tion of such policies depends heavily on the national circumstances, priorities and capabilities \\nof individual countries. While some countries are already aspiring to electricity sectors without \\ngas Œ a fuel source that has been an important transition fuel for moving away from coal Œ oth\\n-ers must first provide reliable, affordable, sustainable and modern energy access to growing \\npopulations and may turn to other forms of energy they have readily available. \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also brought change to the energy industry with investment in renew\\n-able energy sources faring best through the downturn. Some countries are utilizing a share of the \\nfiscal stimulus aimed at boosting economic recovery to support the energy industry and specifi\\n-cally the development of clean technologies, advancements in energy efficiency and an enhanced \\nrole for renewables. However, policy makers must also walk a fine line as there is always the \\npotential for energy-related policies to be misdirected or to be unnecessarily burdensome on the \\neconomy, with regressive social impacts creating challenges for resilient, just, inclusive and sus\\n-tainable development. \\nThis section introduces some of the key energy policies that have influenced this year™s WOO \\nReference Case with the assumption that energy policies in major countries will continue to evolve \\nas an extension of recent trends. Broadly, enacted policies are mostly assumed to be met. As the \\nrecent past has shown, not every target will be met or met on time, and some major policies may \\nonly be implemented partially. However, legally binding targets, as already seen in the likes of the \\nUK and the EU, will likely help ensure adherence to ambitious targets in the future. A summary \\nof key energy policies in major countries is provided in the following sections and more detail on \\nthese policies is provided in Chapter 7. \\nUSThe US, the second largest global emitter, officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement on 4 \\nNovember 2020, and its then administration rolled back more than 100 climate-related rules. \\nHowever, the newly elected US President, Joe Biden, signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris \\nAgreement on 20 January 2021 Œ only hours after his inauguration. The US formally rejoined on 19 \\nFebruary 2021, and the new administration has proposed a national climate plan, aiming to phase \\nout fossil fuels by expanding renewable energy capacity while creating jobs. However, the scale of \\nthe new administration™s shift towards cleaner energy will only be seen in the years to come, and \\nwill likely be influenced by a wide range of issues. \\nUpon assuming office, the current administration signed an executive order on its climate \\nchange policy initiatives, giving instructions to various departments of the federal govern\\n-ment to begin work towards more ambitious goals for climate change concerns. Returning to \\nthe world stage, the US hosted a Leaders™ Summit on Climate in April 2021 and submitted its \\nNationally Determined Contribution (NDC) after re-joining the Paris Agreement, emboldened \\nwith a new target for 2030 that aims for a reduction in emissions of 50Œ52% from 2005 levels. \\nThe administration has also moved to reverse many of the Trump administration™s changes, \\ndirecting the government to review regulations and actions undertaken during the four years of \\nthe previous administration. \\n43Amongst the headline targets is a plan to create an emission-free electricity sector by 2035. \\nNew drilling activity on federal land was again put on hold, while federal-level fossil fuel subsi\\n-dies are under scrutiny Œ although it is uncertain what impact this would have on the tax deduc\\n-tions available for exploration and production. Additionally, the permit for the much-opposed \\nKeystone XL oil pipeline between Nebraska, US and Alberta, Canada has been revoked. The \\noil and gas industry will also be impacted by proposed methane emissions limits, seeking to \\nreduce leaks, venting and flaring, and this could be applied to both new and existing oil and gas \\noperations.\\nIn other policy proposals, the adoption of EVs in the US will receive a boost from the administra\\n-tion™s infrastructure plans. While the final size and scope is still under negotiation in the legisla\\n-ture, current proposals are in the trillions of dollars and a share of this is earmarked for invest\\n-ment in the EV industry, including support for a network of 500,000 charging points across the US \\nby 2030, as well as further rebates and tax incentives for buyers. \\nDelivering on these policy goals, either through regulation (via the Environmental Protection \\nAgency (EPA), for example) or through legislation will not be straightforward and the administra\\n-tion™s first term will undoubtedly be challenging. The administration™s slim Senate majority (only \\nable to pass legislation with the vice-president™s tie-breaking vote) does not guarantee the passing \\nof new pieces of legislation, particularly with the filibuster remaining in place. This could present a \\nbarrier to cementing in law the 2050 target for net-zero emissions, which the new administration \\nhopes to do so to join other countries that have already announced this target.\\nEUThe EU™s energy policy in 2020 was dominated by the arrival of the ambitious European Green \\nDeal. This framework, which sets out the EU™s aim to become the world™s first climate-neutral \\ncontinent, continues to be developed and reinforced with new legislation and updated proposals. \\nIn December 2020, the EU and its Member States submitted their updated NDCs. In April 2021, \\nan important deal was agreed on a Climate Law that once given final approval would put the EU™s \\n2050 target of net-zero emissions into law and require Member States to take the necessary policy \\naction to achieve the target, with systems in place to monitor progress.\\nIn practice, it is likely that the policies of this decade, up to the year 2030, will ultimately deter\\n-mine if the 2050 net-zero emission target can be met. The EU has acknowledged that the speed \\nof progress has to be strengthened, and in September 2020 it proposed to set a 2030 target for \\nGHG emissions reduction to 55%, compared to 1990 levels. This is an increase from the original \\n40% reduction target. The EU Commission, therefore, asked for proposals to bolster legislation to \\nachieve this and on 14 July 2021 it provided a wide ranging, but interlinked set of proposals known \\nas the ‚Fit for 55™ package that would revise key energy policies including the Emissions Trading \\nSystem (ETS), the Effort Sharing Regulation and the Renewable Energy Directive, amongst others, \\nas well as provide proposals for new initiatives\\nThe year 2021 was already an important step for the EU ETS as it entered the fourth phase of its \\nevolution. Operating on a ‚cap and trade™ system, this latest phase was to reduce the cap Œ the \\nmaximum allowed annual emissions Œ at a faster rate of 2.2% p.a., while also boosting efforts to \\nreduce the surplus of allowances that have built up over time. This rate will now be increased to \\n4.2% p.a. and the maritime sector will be phased into the ETS.\\nIt is also important to note that the EU proposes to create a parallel ETS for the buildings and \\ntransportation sectors. Furthermore, a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) has been \\nproposed, which would require that goods exported to the EU also consider GHG emissions, to \\nhelp avoid what is known as ‚carbon leakage™ as businesses move production to regions with \\nlesser environmental restrictions.\\n44In the long-term and for sectors that cannot easily be decarbonized, such as heavy industry, the \\nEU, like other major economies, is looking at the use of hydrogen. The development of hydrogen \\nas a part of the energy mix is at a very early stage and still requires significant development in the \\nareas of technology, infrastructure and investment. In addition, it may not as yet be cost competi\\n-tive, especially not for the EU™s focus on ‚green hydrogen™ that is made through electrolysis with \\nelectricity sourced from renewables.\\nChinaThe widely anticipated unveiling of the 14th Five-Year Plan (FYP) took place at China™s National \\nPeople™s Congress in March 2021. The overarching strategy sets out the country™s broad goals for \\nthe period 2021Œ2025, directing and influencing government policy, as well as energy policy. The \\nplan™s target increases were an update of the previous FYP, with some expecting more significant \\npolicy changes surrounding climate change, but it instead focused more on ensuring economic \\ngrowth, building China™s domestic market, and the short-term recovery from the pandemic. \\nChina still has much to think about when setting new energy policy. On one hand, its 1.4 billion \\npeople are using more and more energy each year, even if population growth is now plateau\\n-ing. In addition, energy security is a central issue for China as the country imports 70% of its oil. \\nTherefore, the use of nuclear, coal and renewables are logical areas of focus when planning its \\nfuture energy mix. China has announced its aim to increase its nuclear power capacity by 40% \\nfrom 50 gigawatts (GW) in 2020 to 70 GW in 2025. In addition, the country intends to get 20% of its \\ntotal energy consumption from non-fossil fuels by 2025, compared to 15.9% in 2020.\\nOn the other hand, China has announced several targets related to climate change, most notable \\nis the carbon neutrality target for 2060, which is connected to the earlier target of reaching peak \\ncarbon emissions by 2030. The 14th FYP does not yet provide many specifics or reforms on how \\nthis goal will be met, it is expected that more details will be gradually made available in the near \\nfuture. \\nChina has also long planned the launch of a nationwide ETS and following regional pilots in previ\\n-ous years, the national system has been taking shape in 2021. The system will first cover the power \\nsector and around 40% of China™s carbon emissions, before future expansion to other sectors. As \\na key instrument to limit carbon emissions, the system should result in long-term changes to the \\nenergy mix. For example, the largest source of CO\\n2 emissions is coal use in the power sector with \\n38.4 GW of coal plants being added in 2020, slightly more than what was lost from the phase out of \\nolder plants. The ETS should drive an increase in plant efficiency and a switch to fuels with lower \\ncarbon emissions.\\nIndiaEnergy use per capita in India may still be low when compared to other major economies, but \\nIndia™s growing population, urbanization and income levels will ensure that the rapid energy \\ndemand increase over the last few decades will continue. Providing power to what will become \\nthe largest population in the world in the medium- to long-term will be challenging. In the short-\\nterm, however, any policy changes will be considered against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pan\\n-demic. It has been an extremely difficult time for India in 2021 with very high numbers of COVID-\\n19 cases, particularly in the 2Q21, and, therefore, the focus remains on combating the pandemic \\nand maintaining economic resilience.\\nOther priorities for India include improving energy access to all its citizens and, so far, it has been \\nvery successful in its endeavours. However, there is still work to be done in moving away from \\nthe use of biomass as a cooking fuel, which is a major health concern. Government subsidy pro\\n-grammes continue to support the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for this purpose, helping \\n45to make the fuel as affordable as traditional biomass. In general, government policies are focused \\non leveraging more gas with an increase in urban natural gas distribution networks. \\nIn energy policy, the Indian government has shown increased ambition in the area of renewables: \\nnot just to meet climate targets, but also to reduce dependency on oil imports. India has the high\\n-est dependency on fossil fuels for electricity generation amongst major countries and existing \\npolicies are already attempting to boost domestic oil production and increase the share of blended \\nfuels, such as bioethanol, in the transport sector. Amongst the options for reaching the govern\\n-ment™s headline target of 450 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030, solar is at the forefront \\ndue to its relative low cost. \\nAs a greater share of the population utilize modern household appliances, a number of policy \\nefforts targeting energy efficiency have evolved, for instance, through standards and labelling to \\nhelp consumers select energy efficient devices, or the India Cooling Action Plan, launched in 2019, \\nwhich looks at improvements in the efficiency and technology of air conditioning units. Along with \\nother government programmes, such as the distribution of hundreds of millions of Light Emitting \\nDiodes (LEDs), energy efficiency efforts are helping to save a large amount of energy use and \\nlessen the overall increase in energy demand.\\nAfricaThe African energy sector has made progress in recent years regarding energy policies that will \\nenhance the continent™s socio-economic development. Many African countries have national energy \\nstrategies to be implemented, albeit with differing time horizons. In some cases, these energy strat\\n-egies are part of a broader strategy to boost the country™s economy, and/or to reduce energy poverty. \\nBox 2.1 of this edition of the WOO provides an insight into the potential future energy demand of Africa. \\nMajor regulatory frameworks have been put in place to achieve economic growth and sustainable \\ndevelopment in the African energy sector and ensure access to affordable, reliable and sustaina\\n-ble energy for all, with a focus on UN SDG 7. The African Union Agenda 2063, the New Partnership \\nfor Africa™s Development (NEPAD), in collaboration with the African Development Bank (AfDB), \\nand the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) undertake policy develop\\n-ment and coordination at the continental and regional levels.\\nOther countries\\nWithin the OECD group of countries, a recurring and increasingly common theme are stringent \\nenergy policies in the medium-term, ultimately focused on meeting climate targets around 2050. \\nSome of the recently announced changes are as follows:\\nŁ The UK has increased its emissions reduction target to 78% by 2035, compared to 1990 \\nlevels. This is arguably the most ambitious target of major world economies and will be \\nenshrined into law. Amongst others actions, the pathway to meeting this target includes \\nthe continued deployment of renewables in the electricity sector and the change to low-\\ncarbon alternatives for consumers, such as new vehicle sales to be electric and a move to \\nelectric heat pumps in homes. The UK is also set to host COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, in \\nOctober/November 2021.\\nŁ Canada™s NDC is to reduce GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. However, it \\nwas announced at the April 2021 Leaders™ Summit on Climate convened by the US admin\\n-istration that Canada will now reduce its GHG emissions by 40Œ45% below 2005 levels by \\n2030, and move forward on a path to reach ‚net-zero™ emissions by 2050. \\nŁ Japan announced at the Leaders™ Summit on Climate a 2030 target to reduce GHG emis\\n-sions by 46%, however, this is compared to 2013 levels. Its previous target was 26%, which \\nwas largely criticized as being insufficient and unambitious. \\n46Ł South Korea announced it would raise its 2030 target later this year, which currently aims \\nfor a 24.4% emissions reduction by 2030, compared to 2017 levels. The country™s electricity \\nsector is the focus of efforts to reduce coal use, which made up around 40% of the energy \\nmix in 2019, by closing coal power plants and converting all others to use gas as a fuel by \\n2034. The above countries and several others have announced net-zero emissions targets for 2050.\\n1.4 Technology and innovation\\nBoth current and future technologies will play a significant role in shaping the future energy land\\n-scape. The development, and implementation of technologies covering a multitude of areas con\\n-tributes to helping set the scene for the Reference Case. The WOO 2021 explores different energy \\nsectors with a specific focus on energy demand, as well as how these might shift or transform the \\noutlook. The WOO assumes a continued evolution of technology. The development and prospects \\nfor new technologies related to the global energy business, including possible breakthroughs are \\nalso explored, including for a long-term perspective.\\n1.4.1 Road transportation\\nThis Outlook assumes that internal combustion engines (ICEs) remain the leading technology for \\nboth passenger and commercial road transport segments. The fast pace of technology advancement \\nover many decades has contributed significantly to the efficiency of these types of engines. Although \\nelectric mobility has undergone some remarkable advancements that are expected to continue, the \\noutlook sees ICEs remaining dominant throughout the forecast period. \\nWhile ICEs still represent the largest share of the market for light duty commercial vehi-\\ncles, a diverse range of electric drive technologies are noticeably becoming more competitive. \\nImprovements in battery technology, and the support of governments to meet fuel efficiency and \\nemission regulations, are helping push electrification in this market segment. However, the other \\ntwo segments of commercial vehicles will likely be less affected by electrification during the fore\\n-cast period. \\nFor passenger vehicles, ICEs are expected to continue to dominate this sector, but powertrain \\nelectrification is now making inroads into this segment, with battery electric (EV), hybrid (HEV), \\nand fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV). Moreover, future developments in battery technology are \\nexpected to overcome many of the current limitations they face, which places a burden on oil pow\\n-ered ICE to introduce redesigned engines that are more fuel-efficient and meet lower emissions \\nregulations.\\nAs battery technology continues to improve, increasing energy density and range, and the cost of \\npassenger EVs inevitably reaches parity with ICE vehicles in the medium-term (supported by gov\\n-ernment incentives in the vast majority of countries) the last major area vital to the mass adoption \\nof EVs is infrastructure. Here efforts are needed to incentivize and support the rollout of superfast \\ncharging infrastructure. \\nThe commercial vehicle segment in the overall fleet is dominated by diesel powertrains. Demand \\nfor this type of vehicles Œ light, medium and heavy commercial vehicles Œ has grown in recent \\nyears and it is expected to continue growing over the forecast period, especially in developing \\ncountries. This is mainly due to diesel being the most economically attractive technology, espe\\n-cially for heavy duty vehicles. Nevertheless, some penetration of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and \\ncompressed natural gas (CNG) driven vehicles into this segment is assumed as well. Moreover, \\nCNG vehicles are also set to expand in the passenger cars segment, especially in several Asian \\ncountries.  \\n47The COVID 19 pandemic has had a negative impact on shared mobility, ride-hailing, and internet-\\nbased on-demand mobility services. Demand has plummeted significantly on the back of government \\nlockdown measures, remote working and social distancing measures. However, it is expected that \\nshared mobility will gradually recover in conjunction with lockdown measures being eased, the wide \\ndeployment of vaccines, and the return of more employees to their office work environment.\\n1.4.2 Air transportation\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on demand for air transportation. The International \\nAir Transport Association (IATA) stated that the global Revenue Passenger Kilometres (RPK) dropped \\ny-o-y to an average of 66% in 2020. The effects on the industry have continued in 2021. In April 2021, \\nWillie Walsh, the IATA™s Director General said: ﬁThis crisis is longer and deeper than anyone could \\nhave expected. Losses will be reduced from 2020, but the pain of the crisis increases.ﬂ \\nIt is clear that air transport remains challenged, particularly on international routes, there are \\ngreater complexities for travel, related to such issues as government policies on quarantine and \\nsocial distancing measures, there has been a drop off in consumer confidence, and falling global \\ntrade volumes. \\nHowever, with optimism for a global economic recovery in the coming years, it is expected that the \\nair transport sector will witness a rebound, albeit a slow and gradual recovery in the short-term. \\nLooking more medium- to long-term, a key contributing factor to the air transportation recovery is \\nthe rising expansion of the middle class Œ reflecting the largest segment of demand in the global \\neconomy Œ and the rapid increase in the global population. \\nWhile 2020 and 2021 have been extremely tough years for the air transportation sector, it has not \\nstopped the industry from introducing a new generation of aircraft focused on enhanced efficien\\n-cies. Aircraft manufacturers have been building more efficient aircraft, ensuring high flight loads, and \\nenacting carbon offsetting schemes. The transition towards Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has been \\nidentified as one of the key factors in reducing GHG emissions across the industry in a step to further \\nreduce its climate footprint. Overall, and relative to 2005, the industry aims by 2050 to reduce net avia\\n-tion CO2 emissions by 50%. Other features of the next generation of aircraft includes innovative rede\\n-signs of the fuselage and wings to help reduce fuel consumption and increase passenger capacity. \\nElectrification in this sector is still in its infancy, with it mainly being focused on small (one-to-two \\nseat) aircraft equipped with electric motors running on battery power. There are also a number of \\ncompanies developing so-called urban air taxis, for short distance flights, but there remain signifi\\n-cant challenges for electrification in medium- and long-range flights, as well as for larger appli\\n-cations. Other potential challenges in air transport electrification include redesigning aircrafts to \\naccommodate power-to-weight ratios, and the reliability and certification of new aircraft technology. \\n1.4.3 Marine transport\\nThe global cap on marine fuel emissions from the International Maritime Organization (IMO), \\nenforced on 1 January 2020 has resulted in a significant demand reduction for high-sulphur fuel \\noil (HSFO). Known as IMO 2020, the regulations in Annex VI of the International Convention for the \\nPrevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), set a new cap mandating a maximum sulphur content \\nof 0.5% in marine fuels globally. In June 2021, Argentina became the 100th contracting state to ratify \\nthese IMO regulations on cutting air pollution from shipping. The IMO said that with Argentina™s rati\\n-fication, the regulations now apply to 96.65% of world merchant shipping by tonnage. \\nOther developments focused on emissions and efficiency from the IMO for the marine transport \\nsector, include a reduction in annual GHG emissions from shipping by 50% in 2050, and a reduc\\n-tion in average carbon intensity by 40% in 2030 and 70% in 2050, compared to 2008 levels. \\n48These challenges for the industry have expedited the search for cleaner and more fuel-efficient \\ntechnologies. \\nMarine ICEs continue to be the mainstay of the marine transport sector. The modern versions \\nof marine ICEs can achieve efficiency rates above 50%, with less fuel consumption and less \\nexhaust emissions. New modern ICEs can also be dual-fuel operated, using LNG as a secondary \\nfuel. It is projected that LNG usage will expand in marine modern ICEs in the medium- to long-\\nterm. In fact, LNG could become the dominant fuel, especially for large ocean-going vessels. \\nThe advantage of LNG would be a significantly reduction in carbon dioxide (CO\\n2) emissions, com\\n-pared to liquid fuels. Moreover, there is growing interest in the shipping industry to use ammo\\n-nia as an alternative fuel for large vessels.\\nElectrification in the marine transport is emerging, albeit slowly. The technology advancement in \\nboth electric propulsion and battery storage systems are likely to play a role in emission reduc\\n-tions to meet the IMO™s global target. The sector, however, is not necessarily willing to compro\\n-mise cargo space and range to implement this technology for maritime applications. \\n1.4.4 Conventional and renewable power generation\\nThe penetration of renewables into the electricity generation sector is set to rise throughout \\nthe WOO™s forecast period. As part of the energy mix, renewables, led by wind and solar, is \\nexpected to gradually phase out mostly coal, as well as some natural gas and oil-fired electric\\n-ity generation. \\nCoal-fired power plants have matured and the efficiency advantage brought to the industry by \\nusing boilers with supercritical thermodynamic cycles has allowed efficiency to rise above 45%. \\nHowever, they are being phased out in many regions and countries, such as the EU and the UK, \\nwhich has also led to a decline in CO\\n2 emissions. The electricity generation output from coal-fired \\npower plants in the EU and the UK has reduced by 60% since 2000. In conjunction with policy \\nmeasures and related economics, it is clear that coal-fired power plants will see a further phase-\\nout in the years and decades ahead. In Europe, by 2030, 50% of current coal-fired power plants are \\nexpected to be either closed or scheduled to be permanently shut.\\nChina, on the other hand, is taking a different approach to phasing-out coal-fired plants, as well \\nas building new ones. With 1,037 active coal-fired plants, 186, or 18%, have been flagged with \\ndeficient performance and are up for early decommissioning. Furthermore, the country is partly \\nreplacing old, and inefficient, coal power and heat plants with more efficient and centralized \\ncoal plants (so-called ‚clean coal™). Approximately 250 GW of coal-fired power plants are under \\n development in China.\\nBoth economics and policy measures are driving the increase in coal-to-gas switching and \\ncontributing to a drop in CO\\n2 emissions. In the US, the switch from coal-to-gas, due to an\\n abundance of natural gas, has been behind the recent decline of CO\\n2 in the power generation \\nsector. With its large output and high-cycle efficiency, gas-powered combined cycle power plants \\n(CCPPs) will remain by far the least CO\\n2-emitting fossil-fueled power plants. Such an advantage \\nshould not be underestimated as countries and regions look to tackle climate change at low \\n investment costs. \\nIn Europe, for instance, both the increasing competitiveness of gas, along with the EU ETS, are \\naiding the push for gas-fired generation. Overall, CCPPs are more advantageous (fuel-to-power) \\nthan supercritical coal power plants, due to a higher thermal efficiency. Furthermore, enhancing \\npower plant efficiencies can be achieved via cogeneration (power and heat), with gas-fired com\\n-bined heat and power (CHP) potentially reaching an overall efficiency range between 65% and \\nalmost 90%.\\n49Low-emission production is driven by the increasing share of renewables Œ mainly wind and \\nsolar. Hydropower is also an important component of renewables. It is worth highlighting that \\npower generation (and other energy use) may be carbon-neutral, but not necessarily renewable. \\nMoreover, renewable energies can be subject to either climatic disruptions for hydropower, or to \\nweather conditions that make them inherently intermittent (sunshine or wind speed). \\nThe increased share of renewables in the power generation mix has been driven by both energy \\nsupply security, and the need to diversify the primary energy base as a whole. The introduc\\n-tion of new technologies, while improving current ones, championed by massive investment \\nand supported by significant direct and indirect subsidies, has contributed to increasing the \\nefficiency of photovoltaic (PV) cells or enlarging the range of useful wind speeds for wind \\nturbines, for instance. The financial backing of renewables has brought down their power-\\ngeneration costs rapidly to now compete with conventional means of electricity generation. \\nAdditionally, and with the leveled costs of generation for both wind and solar declining fur\\n-ther, these trends are likely to continue, making them increasingly competitive relative to fos\\n-sil fuel-based generation. \\nEnergy storage technologies on a large scale are still a missing link to support the strong uptake \\nof renewables, despite the substantial efforts to push advances in this area and the possibili\\n-ties for electrification in various energy sectors. Battery storage continues to progress in terms \\nof cycle stability and specific costs. However, with current battery technology for industrial-scale \\npower, storage seems unlikely to compete with fossil fueled back-up plants. \\nVarious power-to-fuel concepts propose to store renewable power as a fuel for the use in com\\n-bustion engines or fuel cells. However, they are currently not economically viable and may only \\nbecome so when cheaper renewable power is available in the future. Besides, renewable power \\nfor industrial-scale use is often generated in larger volumes far from consuming centres Œ in dis\\n-tant locations, offshore or in the desert. As a result, that energy must be transmitted Œ by high-\\nvoltage systems Œ from producing to consuming locations. This Outlook takes into account such \\nsecondary effects impacting the expansion of renewable power.\\nThe ability to store energy is essential to ensure security of supply and achieve a balance between \\nsupply and demand. The management of the electricity network is another dimension to be \\ntaken into consideration, since production must adapt instantly to demand, or even anticipate it. \\nHowever, the lack of energy storage entails a higher rate of back-up power (mostly gas- and coal-\\nbased) to offset the intermittency of wind and solar power generation. \\n As the world takes gradual steps on the pathway to cleaner electricity, the development of blue \\nhydrogen (see below) electricity generation, which could be of interest for future oil applica\\n-tions, is also underway and is subject to the advancements of carbon capture and storage and/or \\n utilization (CCS/CCU). Refining systems have a traditional role in providing transportation fuels. Yet, recent developments, \\nnamely IMO regulations and carbon constraining policies, could force bottom-of-the-barrel fuels \\nlike fuel oil to seek other outlets. Steady and favourable oil and carbon pricing could aid the promo\\n-tion, and development, of stationary fuel cells in a carbon-constrained pathway. Thermodynamic \\ncycles using supercritical CO\\n2 also has potential in electricity applications, although this is still at a \\nconceptual stage.\\n1.4.5 Hydrogen\\nThe energy transition may be seen as a structural shift toward a more sustainable energy sys\\n-tem and as a pathway toward a transformation of the global energy sector to a net zero-carbon \\nenergy system. In the context of the energy transition, hydrogen is also emerging as a solution to \\n50many challenges, playing the role of energy carrier as an alternative to fossil fuels. Furthermore, \\nthe fact that hydrogen is a chemical product is very attractive as a means to aid massive energy \\nstorage. \\nIn the medium- to long-term, hydrogen could help reduce emissions in many sectors, such as \\nthe industrial and transport sectors, and it could be utilized for blending in gas networks. In the \\nlonger-term, hydrogen storage can be developed as a complementary solution to enable flexibility \\nin the electricity system, which is a potential issue due to the intermittency of renewable energy \\nsources. \\nBlue hydrogen is derived from fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, but with emitted CO\\n2 captured \\nto be reused or stored. Mature technologies exist for the production of ‚blue hydrogen™, however, \\nit is highly dependent on feedstock costs and the development of carbon capture technology. The \\ncontinued development of the blue hydrogen business model will help it become cost competi\\n-tive with other forms of hydrogen. Hydrogen produced from renewable energy sources, or ‚green \\nhydrogen™, has greater challenges, particularly related to scaling up to overcome cost hurdles, \\nand especially in centralized applications to enable electricity generation at scale and to penetrate \\nhard to abate industrial sectors.\\nTherefore, blue hydrogen could play a pivotal role in the energy transition in the near future; help\\n-ing to meet the world™s increasing demand for hydrogen. The topic of policies related to hydrogen \\nis covered further in Chapter 7.\\n1.4.6 Embracing Industry 4.0 and future prospects in technology and\\n cybersecurityIn the midst of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution, or Industry 4.0 as it is widely known, the \\noil and gas industry has huge opportunities to develop, evolve and implement new technologies \\ninto its complex value chain. To date, rapid technology advancements have enabled the industry \\nto explore new methods for increasing production, minimizing associated operational costs, and \\nreducing environmental pollution. \\nLooking ahead, the advancement of cellular networks, via the introduction of 5G, is paving the way \\nto a fully connected world. Coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G technology will help maxi\\n-mize the potential of diverse modern-day technologies and applications. Combining AI, in addi\\n-tion, will create more opportunities, and help the development of further applications that may \\nreshape the future industry. \\nThe ongoing development of sixth generation wireless communication technology will enable \\n3D networks and Networks-On-Chip architecture. Such development will further enhance radio \\naccess competency and on-demand edge cloud services in the 3D space. Thus, it will enable a \\nhyper-connected world with extremely immersive experiences via haptic experiences.\\nA further issue in the technology relates to cyber security, which is an existential challenge for the \\nenergy sector. The integration of IT systems with operational technology systems can place unique \\ncybersecurity risks on industries, and creates vulnerability throughout the value chain. This was \\nbrought to the fore in 2021 following the ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the US, \\nunderscoring the critical importance of cyber resilience for the industry,\\nThe industry is taking a multi-pronged approach to help mitigate potential disruptions from \\ncyberattacks, particularly given the fact that the cyber threat landscape is rapidly evolving and \\nexpanding.\\n51Digitalization and other disruptive related-technologies, such as blockchain, cloud comput\\n-ing, the IoT, ultra-high bandwidth networks and AI, have undoubtedly become critical forces \\ninfluencing the transformational changes shaping the future industry and energy land\\n-scapes. For instance, tremendous progress has been made in mobility driven by ultra-relia\\n-ble and performant wireless networks (i.e.4G/5G radio networks), the continuous increase of \\ncomputational power and hardware cost reduction validating Moore™s law, and the improve\\n-ments in electrical energy storage with batteries providing sufficient operational autonomy.\\nThe commercialization of technologies and the accelerated digital transformation has been \\nall the more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Extensive home office and remote \\nworking in many economic sectors during the pandemic were a necessity and pushed the \\nmore effective use of digital technologies worldwide. Hence, this crisis constitutes an oppor\\n-tunity to continue shifting information technologies from a role of support enablers to stra\\n-tegic ones. Digital innovation is reinforcing its position as a high priority strategic driver in \\nall economies and in the energy sector in particular.\\nImproving efficiencies\\nThe 2014Œ2015 market downturn pushed companies to improve organizational and opera\\n-tional efficiencies by investing heavily in process re-engineering to integrate and automate \\nvarious technologies to better align overall optimization processes. \\nIn facilities and operations there has been extensive use of advanced data analytics, AI in \\nreservoir modelling to improve oil recovery and reduce the marginal cost of the barrel. Site \\nreachability and remote monitoring is also continually improving through the use of robotics \\nand airborne drones, which improve the management of assets in all terrains and weather \\nconditions, as well as machine-to-machine technologies and sensors. \\nAnother major disruptive technology that has advanced in recent years is blockchain, which \\nhas helped revolutionize transactions. Its versatility, and its use of cryptography and Internet \\nProtocol networks to create a distributed leger in which data is impossible to modify or alter, \\noffers significant advantages. Its transparency and its faster transactions could be applied to \\nvarious areas of the oil and gas industry; an industry with a global reach, with often diverse \\nstructures and regulations.\\nNot only does blockchain allow for improved operations and cost reductions based on smart \\ncontracts and asset tracking, it can also be used for monetary transactions. Procurement, \\nticketing, access to information, optimizing operations and scheduling logistics are just \\nsome examples. \\nDigitalization and blockchain technology is also permeating oil and commodity trading. New \\ntechnologies are helping improve the storage, logistics and the transaction and transpar\\n-ency of physical commodities like oil, but it is also evident that the impact of algorithmic \\ntrading, quantitative trading and high-frequency trading can exacerbate market volatility. \\nA recurring mistake is to precede with technology adoption before sound change manage\\n-ment. Digitalization or digital transformation is first and foremost a change management \\nBox 1.1\\nDigitalization in the oil and gas industry: opportunities and\\nrisks52process, which aims at optimizing value creation by increasing efficiency and minimizing \\nlosses. A successful digital transformation starts with a clear and reasonable vision, it is \\nwell formulated and is based on an appropriate strategy. \\nNew technologies, new risks\\nSecurity, regulatory challenges and the governance dimension need to be borne in mind \\nwhen utilizing new technologies. As oil and gas companies rapidly digitize operations, they \\nsimultaneously expose themselves to cyber risks. Cyberattacks can come in a variety of \\nforms, with motivations ranging across financial, criminal and/or geopolitical arenas. The \\nUS Colonial Pipeline closure due to a cyberattack in early 2021 is just one example in terms \\nof disruptive implications.\\nTherefore, it is critical for oil and gas companies to consider cybersecurity as an integral part \\nof their business model to protect their activities, industrial operations and assets, espe\\n-cially in a globally interconnected setting. This calls for increased cooperation to enhance \\nawareness for cybersecurity and improve cyber resilience. \\nAnother major concern is the exponentially growing dependence of raw material, such as rare \\nearths to create all type of digital objects. The magnetic, conducting, luminescent and elec\\n-trochemical properties of around 30 rare earths make them exclusively necessary for wind \\nturbines, batteries, electrical storage and smart grids. Rare earths are scarce, unevenly geo\\n-graphically distributed and require much energy to extract. Not to mention the associated neg\\n-ative environmental impact resulting from their production and purification processes.\\nFurthermore, digitalization requires more cloud infrastructures that will be needed to sat\\n-isfy the huge distributed computational and data storage needs of artificial intelligence algo\\n-rithms. All this will result in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) becoming \\nextremely energy consuming. For example, cooling data centres has become a serious issue \\nespecially for AI clouds and blockchain mining clusters. \\nThere is a need to raise awareness with respect to the extensive use of ICTs. Huge amounts \\nof energy can be saved by improving software algorithms, eliminating duplicated data, while \\nkeeping necessary security redundancies. Deleting unnecessary storages and deploying \\npower management algorithms are just a few ways to reduce ICT power consumption. More \\nimportant is increasing end user awareness on how to use ICTs in a more efficient way.\\nFuture prospects\\nToday, 5G is already offering ultra-reliable connected mobility of things; it allows for much \\nmore devices within a given area and uses the spectrum resources more efficiently The next \\ngeneration of mobile networks, 6G, is already undergoing standardization and is expected to \\nbe released in the upcoming decade. The use of 6G will underpin AI, blockchain technology, \\nand autonomous machines. It will leverage on improvements in semiconductors that will \\nrun at much higher frequencies with more integration densities. \\nMoore™s law is expected to remain valid for the next decade thanks to advancements in mul\\n-tilayer semiconductors integration. This means computational power will continue its rising \\ntrend and so will power consumption. The huge amounts of generated data will need more \\nstorage, energy and cooling.\\nAll these developments, and the expectations for future ones, will require the industry to \\ncontinually evolve and transform from a human perspective. Investment in human capital \\nand upskilling in an environment, where data plays a central role, will be vital. \\n53These shifts, as well as changes in the way the world conducts business, has also been exac\\n-erbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Will these new ways of working become new standards? \\nSomething is sure; digitalization has gained great momentum and will not be seen the same \\nway.\\nCOVID-19 has further advanced digitalization and new technologies, and in the face of \\nthese rapid changes, the oil and gas industry has to work together to leverage its poten\\n-tial and to take full advantage of digitalization in light of the lessons learned from the \\nCOVID-19 crisis. \\n54Energy demand\\n55Key takeaways\\nŁ Global energy demand is set to increase from 275.4 mboe/d in 2020 to 352 mboe/d by \\n2045. Ł China, India, and other developing nations will continue to drive global energy demand \\ngrowth.\\nŁ Global demand for oil-based products is projected to reach 94.5 mboe/d in 2025 and \\n 99 mboe/d in 2045.Ł Oil demand in non-OECD countries is set to increase and, despite decelerating oil \\ndemand growth in the second part of the forecast period, oil will retain the highest share \\nin the global energy mix during the entire forecast period.\\nŁ Oil demand in OECD countries will be marked by a short period of strong growth in recov\\n-ering from the COVID-19 pandemic, before entering a long period of slow, albeit steady \\ndecline.Ł The downward trend for coal demand is accelerated after the pandemic with targeted \\npolicies focused on cleaner energy sources. Coal is the only fuel that experiences nega\\n-tive growth over the forecast period.\\nŁ Natural gas demand is projected to increase from 64.2 mboe/d in 2020 to 85.7 mboe/d \\nin 2045. However, growth is expected to decelerate throughout the outlook period, \\ndue to the rising penetration of renewables and continued efforts to improve energy \\nefficiency.\\nŁ Almost 95% of gas demand growth comes from developing countries, mostly Asia and \\nthe Middle East, driven by the power generation and industrial sectors. By 2030, gas is \\nexpected to overtake coal and become the second largest fuel in the energy mix.\\nŁ Global demand for nuclear and hydro increases moderately over the forecast period, but \\nboth remain important fuel sources in providing sustainable energy supplies. \\nŁ Other renewables driven by policies, technology and the energy transition continue to \\nwitness accelerated growth in all regions. \\nŁ Other renewables maintain the leading role in the growth forecast with a share in the \\nenergy mix moving above 10% in 2045, from just 2.5% in 2020.\\nŁ In both OECD and non-OECD regions, energy efficiency in most sectors will continue to \\nadvance, outpacing improvements achieved in the past 25 years despite the economic \\nshocks related to COVID-19.\\n56COVID-19 has introduced many new uncertainties and yet another demand-related factor; the \\npost-pandemic recovery. The recovery stage induced various economic stimulus packages that \\nare diverse in nature and vary according to the region. The pandemic has also brought new behav\\n-ioural patterns, some of which will likely linger for several years, and in some cases, may become \\nthe new normal. This includes remote working, a shift in transportation modes, and a re-ener\\n-gized resolve for low-carbon energy deployment. These and other fundamental energy demand \\ndrivers will continue to influence present and future energy demand pathways. With the arrival of \\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, renewable energy deployment has received additional impetus, through \\npolicies and fiscal stimulus. Considerations for the rapid development of clean energies and \\nachieving low emission targets have come to the fore, especially in developed nations. \\nDespite the disruption caused by the pandemic, primary energy demand and final consumption \\nare continuously guided by economic growth, supply and demand fundamentals, technology, \\nas well as policy and regulatory frameworks. In a way, the pandemic decelerated the growth of \\nsome energy sources, while accelerating the energy transition and the deployment of low-carbon \\nsources, especially renewable resources. \\nThis chapter highlights the continued leading role of fossil fuels, particularly oil and gas in \\nthe medium- and long-term, but also the significant growth of renewables, albeit from a low \\nstarting base. It focuses on the development, expansion, and deployment of primary energy \\nsources at both the regional and global level for the outlook period from 2020Œ2045. This \\nincludes the interconnectivity of key energy demand drivers during the pandemic, at the recov\\n-ery stage and into the post-pandemic future. It also analyzes the future demand trajectory for \\neach primary energy source, including their inter-play, as well as economic, supply security and \\n sustainability issues.\\nIt is important to note that 2020 is the statistical data baseline for the outlook and for those regions \\nwhere data is not available, the outlook supplements these data sets with estimations from other \\navailable data sets.\\n2.1 Major trends in energy demand\\nEnergy demand encompasses economic activities, demographic factors, and other key fundamen\\n-tals, and the constituents of the energy mix can also be shaped by technology, policy, and regu\\n-latory frameworks. Moreover, consumer behaviour and preferences can play a vital role in final \\nenergy consumption. \\nThe global health emergency and widespread economic lockdowns, induced by the COVID-19 pan\\n-demic, hit demand for primary energy dramatically in 2020, and it is clear this will have an impact on \\nfuture energy deployment and its efficient use. The global economy was devastated during the pan\\n-demic and even large economies entered deep recessions, while other economies dependant on reve\\n-nues from commodities, such as oil, suffered greatly in a time of weakened demand. Consumers spent \\nless money and energy industry investments were hit dramatically. Mobility was temporarily curtailed, \\nas lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus restricted travel, especially road and air transport. \\nThe rebound of energy demand in 2021 followed the successful development and production of \\nvaccines, and lower new infection numbers in many parts of the world. Although it is clear that the \\nspread of COVID-19 variants, particularly the Delta variant from June 2021 onwards, saw cases \\nrise again in some parts of the world. Post-pandemic recovery packages, totalling around $26 \\ntrillion in fiscal and monetary stimulus, including guarantees, have also helped economic activity \\nand, in turn, impacted on the demand rebound. \\nThe pace of the recovery is different for each energy source, however, coal is unlikely to recover \\nto pre-crisis levels, with fuel-switching in electricity generation and policies focused on the \\n57phase-out of coal, limiting any prospects for a post-pandemic coal rebound. Every region has dif\\n-ferent priorities for the recovery, as well as energy transition pathway objectives. This is particu\\n-larly true when looking at the differing challenges of developed and developing nations, therefore, \\nenergy demand also varies on a regional basis. Countries are left with a delicate balancing act, \\nwith options to optimize between emissions reduction, the economic recovery, as well as ensur\\n-ing energy access for all. The pandemic, therefore, exposes the vulnerability of the energy system \\nand its overall fragility.\\nIt is a fact that falling costs for solar and wind power are making renewable electricity gen\\n-eration more competitive globally relative to coal- and gas-fired generation. In some regions, \\nthe levelized cost of generation is already lower for renewable sources. However challenges \\nsuch as accessibility, scale and capacity for renewable power generation remain important \\nconsiderations. \\nEven if renewables are the current focus for carbon neutrality and low emission aspirations, it is \\nimportant to recognize that solutions to reduce emissions can be found in a plethora of technolo\\n-gies, such as CCUS and others, as well in the promotion of the Circular Carbon Economy (CCE) to \\nimprove overall environmental performance. It is clear that all energies have a role to play. \\nDemand for all energy sources fell during the pandemic, with the exception of renewables that \\nproved resilient after an initial stagnation at the start of the 2020 crisis. Moreover, the pandemic \\nalso provided further opportunities to strategize and plan for the further penetration of low-\\ncarbon alternative energy sources, particularly from policymakers in developed countries and \\nregions. The European Green Deal is a key example of this, providing a springboard to drive the \\ndevelopment and deployment of sustainable low-carbon renewable energy sources in the EU, to \\nhelp accomplish its aspiration to attain carbon-neutrality by 2050. More details on the policies of \\nmajor countries and regions are provided in Chapter 7. \\nIn this Outlook, the electrification of the transportation sector progresses at a quicker pace than \\nanticipated in the previous WOO. Although the global market for automobiles suffered a set\\n-back due to the pandemic, the year-on-year (y-o-y) decline did not affect EVs. Charging for these \\nadditional electric vehicles will require additional electricity generation, likely from low-carbon \\nsources and renewables, and will hit the share of oil in the energy mix. This fuel substitution is set \\nto proceed, not only in the transport sector, but in industries, as well heating and electricity gen\\n-eration. The transportation sector is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 3. \\nGlobal emissions significantly declined during the pandemic in 2020 because of mobility restric\\n-tions and lower industrial outputs. Emissions, however, were quick to rebound following the eas\\n-ing of restrictions that increased mobility, and in 2021, as the vaccination roll-out gathered pace.\\nTable 2.1 outlines the expected energy demand trends in the medium- and long-term. Global \\nenergy demand is set to increase from 275.4 mboe/d in 2020 to 352 mboe/d by 2045. Global energy \\ndemand contracted 4.5% in 2020 due to the pandemic, but 2021 has thus far seen a significant \\nrecovery, albeit not to pre-pandemic levels. The 2045 figure is more than 9 mboe/d below that in \\nthe WOO 2020. This is as a result of the expected continued medium-term impacts of COVID-19, \\nGDP revisions, and anticipated further energy efficiency gains.\\nIn terms of the sources and shares for primary energy demand, oil is expected to retain its leading \\nposition even though its share declines. \\nBetween 2020 and 2045, the largest decline in the share of the energy mix is projected for coal, \\ndropping from 26.5% in 2020 to 17.4% by 2045. This is impacted not only by the pandemic, but pre\\n-dominately through the strengthening of policy and regulatory measures that will likely lead to \\nfuel switching and more coal-fired plant shutdowns. It should also be noted that even China and \\n58Table 2.1\\nWorld primary energy demand by fuel type, 2020Œ2045\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nFuel share\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045Oil\\n82.5\\n94.5\\n97.3\\n98.6\\n98.9\\n99.0\\n16.5\\n0.7\\n30.0\\n28.1\\nCoal\\n72.9\\n74.4\\n71.7\\n67.9\\n64.4\\n61.3\\nŒ11.7\\nŒ0.7\\n26.5\\n17.4\\nGas\\n64.2\\n69.8\\n74.8\\n79.5\\n83.2\\n85.7\\n21.6\\n1.2\\n23.3\\n24.4\\nNuclear\\n14.3\\n16.0\\n17.5\\n19.0\\n20.7\\n22.0\\n7.6\\n1.7\\n5.2\\n6.2\\nHydro \\n7.5\\n8.2\\n8.9\\n9.5\\n10.2\\n10.5\\n3.0\\n1.4\\n2.7\\n3.0\\nBiomass\\n27.2\\n29.4\\n31.7\\n33.8\\n35.7\\n37.0\\n9.7\\n1.2\\n9.9\\n10.5\\nOther renewables\\n6.8\\n11.3\\n17.4\\n24.0\\n31.2\\n36.6\\n29.8\\n7.0\\n2.5\\n10.4\\nTotal\\n275.4\\n303.6\\n319.3\\n332.3\\n344.3\\n352.0\\n76.6\\n1.0\\n100.0\\n100.0\\nSource: OPEC.\\nIndia, the largest global coal users, are adopting technologies that increase coal plant efficiencies \\nand reduce pollution, while also shutting down inefficient plants gradually.\\nNatural gas is anticipated to see its share increase slightly. In terms of volume growth, gas is sec\\n-ond to other renewables, adding over 21.5 mboe/d to demand by 2045. Gas demand was also rel\\n-atively well shielded from the impacts of the pandemic in 2020, for a number of reasons. Firstly, \\nnatural gas prices were already declining due to a glut in the market that saw gas prices close \\nto parity with coal, thus making fuel-switching economical. Secondly, regional, and local policies \\nsupport low-carbon natural gas deployment in power generation and space heating. Lastly, LNG \\nand CNG are finding further applications in heavy trucking, shipping and clean cooking, especially \\nin China and India. Therefore, the decline of natural gas during the pandemic is somewhat offset \\nby a combination of these other short- and longer term factors. \\nOther renewables maintain the leading role in the growth forecast with its share in the energy \\nmix in 2045 moving above 10%, from just 2.5% in 2020. This is driven by falling costs and policies \\nfocused on reducing emissions. Biomass reaches a similar level to that of other renewables in \\n2045, at approximately 37 mboe/d, however, with biomass use already at 27.2 mboe/d in 2020, its \\ngrowth over the forecast period is much smaller. \\nWhile a decline in electricity demand reduced the output of nuclear plants during the pandemic, \\nnuclear energy suffered less of a setback than fossil fuels in 2020. Output has recovered in 2021, \\nand in the long-term the role of nuclear energy will be important for climate mitigation and energy \\nsecurity with plants producing a large amount of reliable energy to help meet the baseload needs \\nof countries. In terms of primary energy demand, nuclear is expected to increase from the cur\\n-rent level of 14.3 mboe/d to 22 mboe/d by 2045, growing at high rate of 1.7 % p.a. during the \\n projection period. \\nDevelopments around hydro remain similar to the previous outlook, expanding gradually through\\n-out the forecast period, but making up only 3% of the world™s energy mix by 2045. Limited oppor\\n-tunities for new sources of hydro energy and the need for large capital investments temper growth \\nprospects, especially if investments are deferred due to the pandemic. \\nTurning to the regional outlook, with an anticipated increase in economic prosperity and the urbani\\n-zation of a growing population, energy demand in the non-OECD region is set to expand significantly. \\n59Table 2.2\\nTotal primary energy demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nShare\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045OECD Americas\\n51.0\\n55.3\\n55.1\\n54.5\\n53.7\\n53.4\\n2.4\\n0.2\\n18.5\\n15.2\\nOECD Europe\\n33.5\\n34.8\\n34.0\\n33.1\\n32.2\\n31.4\\nŒ2.1\\nŒ0.3\\n12.2\\n8.9\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n17.0\\n17.9\\n17.9\\n17.8\\n17.5\\n17.3\\n0.3\\n0.1\\n6.2\\n4.9\\nOECD\\n101.5\\n107.9\\n107.0\\n105.3\\n103.4\\n102.1\\n0.6\\n0.0\\n36.9\\n29.0\\nChina\\n66.0\\n73.1\\n75.7\\n76.5\\n77.0\\n78.1\\n12.2\\n0.7\\n23.9\\n22.2\\nIndia\\n17.5\\n21.7\\n25.8\\n30.3\\n34.3\\n37.9\\n20.4\\n3.1\\n6.3\\n10.8\\nOPEC\\n19.0\\n21.7\\n24.7\\n27.6\\n30.2\\n32.0\\n13.0\\n2.1\\n6.9\\n9.1\\nOther non-OECD\\n49.3\\n55.8\\n62.2\\n68.5\\n74.8\\n77.1\\n27.8\\n1.8\\n17.9\\n21.9\\nRussia\\n14.7\\n15.1\\n15.0\\n15.0\\n14.9\\n14.7\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n5.3\\n4.2\\nOther Eurasia\\n7.4\\n8.3\\n8.8\\n9.2\\n9.7\\n10.1\\n2.7\\n1.2\\n2.7\\n2.9\\nNon-OECD\\n173.9\\n195.7\\n212.3\\n227.0\\n240.9\\n249.9\\n76.0\\n1.5\\n63.1\\n71.0\\nWorld\\n275.4\\n303.6\\n319.3\\n332.3\\n344.3\\n352.0\\n76.6\\n1.0\\n100.0\\n100.0\\nAs shown in Table 2.2, energy demand growth in the long-term is almost entirely attributed to these \\ndeveloping regions. The figures in 2045 indicate that non-OECD demand will constitute over 70% \\nof global primary energy demand, expanding from around 174 mboe/d in 2020 to reach almost 250 \\nmboe/d at the end of the projection period. The main drivers for this growth are the Other Developing \\ncountries and India regions, at 27.8 mboe/d and 20.4 mboe/d, respectively.\\nFor the OECD region, energy demand flattens in the long-term due to the energy transition and a \\npolicy push that continues to place increasing emphasis on energy efficiency and the deployment \\nof low carbon energy technologies. After a partial recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pan\\n-demic, medium-term energy demand in the region is set to peak before declining to 102.1 mboe/d \\nby 2045, reaching a level similar to that seen in 2020 during the pandemic (101.5 mboe/d). OECD \\nEurope is forecast to record a drop of 2.1 mboe/d in energy demand between 2020 and 2045, while \\nOECD Americas is forecast to see a similarly sized increase of 2.4 mboe/d. \\nFigure 2.1 depicts the growth of primary energy demand by region covering the forecast period. \\nOECD regions continue to see a decline in primary energy demand with increasing energy effi\\n-ciency, a reduction of energy intensity in industries and the deployment of low-carbon technolo\\n-gies. OECD energy demand starts to decline from 2025 with OECD Europe spearheading the drop \\nat 0.3% p.a. between 2020 and 2045.\\nOn the contrary, non-OECD energy demand grows throughout the outlook period since the \\nregion™s energy intensive industries flourish. This growth is attributable to increasing populations \\nand expanding economies mainly in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The energy use reduction \\nin OECD regions is offset by energy demand from the developing regions. India™s energy growth \\nis set to overtake China™s during the outlook period. This is because of the saturation effects of \\nChina™s economy and the shift away from energy intensive industrialization, as well as the intro\\n-duction of more efficient coal powered technologies that replace non-efficient old coal installa\\n-tions. India™s economy is on a growth trajectory that requires substantial additional energy, with \\n60an anticipation of more energy intensive industrial output driven by population expansion and \\nincreasing urbanization.\\nEnergy use in the OPEC region is set to increase during the outlook period given expectations for \\nincreasing per capita income and higher energy intensity. Additionally, the use of natural gas and \\nrenewables (mainly solar PV) continues to expand in the region. Petrochemical expansion in Middle \\nEast countries is responsible for some of the additional energy requirements, while the direct use \\nof oil is expected to drop in the region. Other Eurasia energy demand grows marginally, at above 1% \\np.a. for the projection period, despite the fall off related to the pandemic at the start of the forecast \\nperiod.Figure 2.1\\nGrowth in primary energy demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.1\\nmboe/d1.83.12.10.71.20.20.10.0Œ0.3Œ0.500.51.01.52.02.53.03.5Œ505101520253035% p.a.mboe/dOtherDCsIndiaOPECChinaRussiaOtherEurasiaOECDAmericasOECD AsiaOceaniaOECDEuropeGrowth (mboe/d)Growth (% p.a.)Figure 2.2\\nGrowth in primary energy demand by fuel type, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.2\\nmboe/dŒ20Œ15Œ10Œ505101520253035OilCoalGasNuclearHydroBiomassOtherrenewablesmboe/d2020Œ20252025Œ20352035Œ204561In terms of global primary energy growth by fuel, the WOO sees the continued dominance of \\nrenewables and gas in comparison to other fuels. The sustained growth of natural gas is due to \\npolicy support and accessibility in some regions, as well as expanding infrastructure and market \\nmechanisms that favour gas over coal for power generation. These advantages mean that gas \\nwitnesses the second largest growth from 2020Œ2045, behind renewables. Figure 2.2 depicts the \\nposition of energy growth by fuels for the forecast period.\\nOther low-carbon fuels with noticeable growth are nuclear and biomass, both of which can sup\\n-port the global decarbonization drive.\\n2.2 Energy demand by region\\nPrimary energy demand continues to vary from region-to-region, and the impact of COVID-19 has \\nreshaped a number of regional energy components, sustainable priorities and energy security \\nconsiderations. The demand disruption resulting from the global pandemic affected all primary \\nenergy sources, in all regions. The onset of the pandemic saw a significant drop in energy demand \\nin every region, which rebounded in earnest when lockdown restrictions were partially lifted or \\neased. China was the first to witness a rebound in energy demand. The post-pandemic rebound \\nhas varied across regions with some recovering faster than others, and this goes for fuel types too. \\nDespite the pandemic, the regional trends for energy use and demand growth seen in previous \\nWOOs are maintained this year. In developed regions, the continued deployment of energy effi\\n-cient technologies and the lower intensive industrial complex is expected to see lower primary \\nenergy requirements on an annual basis in the longer-term. Although energy demand recovers fol\\n-lowing the pandemic in the OECD region, demand remains below pre-crisis levels and there is a \\n nascent growth shift towards renewables, especially in OECD Europe. Furthermore, lower popula\\n-tion expansion, for instance, in OECD Europe and OECD Asia Oceania, saturation levels in the trans\\n-portation sector, and expected GDP growth rates, translate into lower energy demand growth.\\nDeveloping countries see a more diversified and uneven pattern in terms of the energy rebound. \\nThe recovery in weaker non-OECD economies is anticipated to progress at a slower rate, reflect\\n-ing the effects of the pandemic and the subsequent staggered recovery in economic activities.\\nAs noted, the OECD (Table 2.3) continues to deploy less energy intensive solutions and add further \\nrenewable generation capacity that drives decarbonization toward low emission targets. Primary \\nenergy demand in developed regions is forecast to decline for some fossil fuel types over the \\nTable 2.3\\nOECD primary energy demand by fuel type, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nFuel share\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045Oil\\n36.3\\n39.8\\n37.7\\n34.8\\n31.6\\n28.7\\nŒ7.5\\nŒ0.9\\n35.7\\n28.1\\nCoal\\n14.0\\n13.1\\n11.2\\n9.6\\n8.3\\n7.2\\nŒ6.8\\nŒ2.6\\n13.8\\n7.0\\nGas\\n28.6\\n29.9\\n30.0\\n30.0\\n29.9\\n29.7\\n1.0\\n0.1\\n28.2\\n29.1\\nNuclear\\n10.1\\n10.3\\n10.5\\n10.7\\n10.8\\n10.9\\n0.7\\n0.3\\n10.0\\n10.6\\nHydro \\n2.5\\n2.6\\n2.7\\n2.8\\n2.9\\n3.0\\n0.4\\n0.7\\n2.5\\n2.9\\nBiomass\\n6.7\\n7.4\\n8.1\\n8.7\\n9.4\\n10.0\\n3.3\\n1.6\\n6.69.8\\nOther renewables\\n3.2\\n4.8\\n6.8\\n8.7\\n10.6\\n12.6\\n9.5\\n5.7\\n3.1\\n12.4\\nTotal\\n101.5\\n107.9\\n107.0\\n105.3\\n103.4\\n102.1\\n0.6\\n0.0\\n100.0\\n100.0\\n62projection period. This trend has been further assisted by a re-strategizing in the pandemic recov\\n-ery stage to consolidate and place more emphasis on low-carbon and green-energy solutions, thus \\nsubstituting fossil fuels. The OECD stimulus packages and incentives favour deployment and further \\ninvestment into renewables and transport electrification, with some countries setting targets begin\\n-ning in 2030 to limit or ban the sale of new fossil fuel cars in the transport sector.\\nPrimary energy demand in the OECD region contracted by 7.4% in 2020 in the wake of COVID-19. In \\ngeneral, the energy demand rebound began in early 2021 on the back of the vaccine rollout and as \\nlockdown measures were gradually eased. The OECD™s three main regions Œ the US, Europe and \\nJapan Œ have responded to the pandemic differently, each seeing a specific recovery path in terms \\nof the energy mix. However, despite the varied recovery paths, the common longer-term regional \\ncharacteristic is a strengthening of the deployment of renewables and the declining use of coal \\nand oil in most OECD energy systems. As already noted, the long-term projection does not foresee \\nan energy demand rebound to pre-COVID 2019 levels in the OECD. \\nOECD primary energy demand in 2045 is estimated to remain at almost the same level as that of 2020. \\nAs depicted in Table 2.3, OECD energy demand increases on the verge of 0.6 mboe/d. Other renewa\\n-bles and bioenergy further penetrate the OECD energy mix, increasing by 5.7% and 1.6% p.a., respec\\n-tively. Oil and coal see the largest declines, as those fuels are affected by efficiency improvements and \\nfuel-switching, while gas sees a slight increase over the forecast period. Oil sees a drop of 7.5 mboe/d, \\nand the use of coal is anticipated to almost half. In terms of overall levels, however, oil and gas are \\nexpected to remain dominant with a share of over 57% of OECD primary energy demand by 2045. \\nIn contrast, expanding populations, increasing urbanization and growing economic activities \\npushes energy demand upwards in non-OECD regions. The majority of the growth is driven by \\nIndia and China, and there are differing trends regarding fuel types related to resource sustaina\\n-bility and affordability. Consequently, regional and country-specific energy demand growth is gen\\n-erally focused on the deployment of available resources, security of supply and affordable prices. \\nPrimary energy demand in the non-OECD region dropped by 2.3% during the pandemic in 2020, \\ncompared to pre-crisis levels, but the region has witnessed a significant rebound in 2021. Non-\\nOECD energy demand in 2025 is envisioned to be 10.8% higher than 2020 levels.\\nThe non-OECD energy mix is dominated by fossil fuels (Table 2.4), although the combined shares \\ndrop from around 81% in 2020 to just over 72% by the end of the forecast period due to a rising \\nTable 2.4\\nNon-OECD countries primary energy demand by fuel type, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nFuel share\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045Oil\\n46.3\\n54.6\\n59.6\\n63.8\\n67.3\\n70.3\\n24.0\\n1.7\\n26.6\\n28.1\\nCoal\\n58.9\\n61.4\\n60.5\\n58.3\\n56.1\\n54.1\\nŒ4.8\\nŒ0.3\\n33.9\\n21.6\\nGas\\n35.5\\n39.8\\n44.9\\n49.5\\n53.4\\n56.0\\n20.5\\n1.8\\n20.4\\n22.4\\nNuclear\\n4.2\\n5.7\\n7.0\\n8.3\\n9.9\\n11.1\\n6.9\\n4.0\\n2.4\\n4.4\\nHydro \\n5.0\\n5.5\\n6.1\\n6.7\\n7.3\\n7.5\\n2.6\\n1.7\\n2.8\\n3.0\\nBiomass\\n20.5\\n22.1\\n23.6\\n25.1\\n26.4\\n26.9\\n6.4\\n1.1\\n11.8\\n10.8\\nOther renewables\\n3.6\\n6.5\\n10.6\\n15.3\\n20.6\\n24.0\\n20.4\\n7.9\\n2.1\\n9.6\\nTotal\\n173.9\\n195.7\\n212.3\\n227.0\\n240.9\\n249.9\\n76.0\\n1.5\\n100.0\\n100.0\\n63share for low-carbon fuels. All energies, expect coal, see growth over the forecast period, with \\nother renewables and nuclear witnessing the fastest growth rates, at 7.9% and 4%, respectively.\\nChina and India are both forecast to see considerable growth in renewables as they explore decar\\n-bonization and clean energy transition initiatives, but potential expansion is also foreseen within \\nOPEC Member Countries, Africa and Latin America. However, the development and deployment \\nof renewables is subject to capital availability, especially in the post-pandemic recovery phase. \\nOverall, non-OECD energy demand is set to add about 76 mboe/d to reach 250 mboe/d at the end \\nof the outlook period, well over twice the demand of the OECD region. \\nWhile China™s energy demand is expected to continue to expand in the coming decades, surpassing \\nOECD Americas in 2045, growth slows over the forecast period. The slowdown is due to expected \\nstructural changes in the economy, leading to less long-term consumption growth. \\nChina™s energy mix is dominated by fossil fuels, mainly coal, which constituted over a 60% share \\nof its primary energy demand in 2020 (Table 2.5). However, China is strategizing to reduce coal™s \\nshare in the long-term. This is principally achievable by increasing renewable generation, but also \\nthrough the replacement of older inefficient coal plants with newer energy-efficient units, which, \\nin turn, lowers coal demand. At the end of the projection period in 2045, coal™s share in China™s \\nprimary energy demand is forecast to drop to around 35%, which translates to an absolute level of \\nmore than 27 mboe/d. While coal witnesses a drop, oil and gas rise, given the expanding middle \\nclass, further urbanization, and rising mobility levels.\\nTable 2.5\\nChina primary energy demand by fuel type, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nFuel share\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045Oil\\n12.6\\n14.5\\n15.1\\n15.4\\n15.6\\n15.6\\n3.1\\n0.9\\n19.0\\n20.0\\nCoal\\n39.8\\n39.9\\n37.3\\n33.5\\n30.2\\n27.6\\nŒ12.1\\nŒ1.4\\n60.3\\n35.4\\nGas\\n5.0\\n6.7\\n8.1\\n9.1\\n9.8\\n10.1\\n5.1\\n2.8\\n7.6\\n13.0\\nNuclear\\n1.9\\n3.0\\n3.9\\n4.7\\n5.7\\n6.64.8\\n5.2\\n2.8\\n8.5\\nHydro \\n2.1\\n2.3\\n2.5\\n2.6\\n2.8\\n3.0\\n0.8\\n1.3\\n3.2\\n3.8\\nBiomass\\n2.6\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n4.0\\n4.3\\n4.6\\n2.0\\n2.3\\n3.9\\n5.9\\nOther renewables\\n2.0\\n3.5\\n5.3\\n7.18.7\\n10.5\\n8.5\\n6.9\\n3.0\\n13.5\\nTotal\\n66.0\\n73.1\\n75.7\\n76.5\\n77.0\\n78.1\\n12.2\\n0.7\\n100.0\\n100.0\\nThere is an increasing shift to the electrification of passenger cars in China that will displace oil-\\nbased ICE vehicles, but it is expected that the country™s oil requirements in this sector will con\\n-tinue to grow. China™s overall oil requirements expand at an average annual rate of 0.9% till 2045, \\nwhen it is expected to plateau due to the further electrification of the transport sector, lower \\nenergy-intensive industries, as well as additional efficiency improvements. \\nChina™s nuclear capacity is forecast to increase by 2030 in support of its low-carbon deployment \\ninitiatives. With an annual growth rate of 5.2% over the outlook period, nuclear is the second fast-\\ngrowing fuel in the primary energy-mix after renewables. China™s 14th FYP announced in 2021 \\nindicates actions and strategies to add 70 GW of nuclear capacity by 2025. Nuclear generation is \\n64projected to reach 6.6 mboe/d by 2045, representing an 8.5% share of the fuel mix, up from just \\n2.8% in 2020 Other renewables is expected to be the fastest growing fuel in China, expanding on average by \\nalmost 7% p.a. from 2020Œ2045. It is forecast to have a 13.5% share of China™s primary energy \\ndemand at the end of the forecast period. In fact, about half of the non-OECD™s renewable energy \\ngrowth is forecast in China. It should also be noted that China is home to many rare-earth ele\\n-ments, critical components for the energy transition, which provides the country with an advan\\n-tage as it looks to be a global leader in renewables. \\nTable 2.5 indicates that China™s energy demand is forecast to expand at a rate of 0.7% p.a., adding \\nover 12 mboe/d by 2045.\\nIndia is the key centre for global energy growth, with demand expected to grow at 3.1% p.a. over the \\nforecast period. In early 2021, it was anticipated that India™s economy would achieve double-digit \\ngrowth, but the devastating second wave of COVID-19 in the 2Q21 dramatically hit the economy, and \\nraised uncertainties as to short-term energy demand. Moreover, it is clear that the ongoing effects \\nof the pandemic, including vaccination rates, will impact on short-term energy demand.\\nAlthough coal, oil and traditional biomass currently dominate India™s energy mix, the country pos\\n-sesses inherent capacity for diversification and flexibility as it looks to satisfy domestic energy \\nrequirements. An expanding working-age population, urbanization and industrial capacity are the \\nmajor drivers for India™s energy demand and economic prosperity. \\nMost of India™s coal resources are utilized for electricity generation, which is on the rise to satisfy \\ndemand from a growing population and as a result India is a global leader in electricity expan\\n-sion. The expansion in new electricity connections and the government supported LPG develop\\n-ment campaigns are helping reduce energy poverty through the expansion of access to electricity \\nand clean cooking fuels, in line with the UN™s SDG 7 initiatives. Moreover, the government™s energy \\nreforms in 2020 are putting key structures in place to drive the development of secure, affordable, \\nand sustainable energy systems to help fuel economic growth.\\nIndia™s future energy map includes provisions to further expand gas infrastructure networks to \\nsupport growing gas-based industries. The outlook (Table 2.6) sees India™s gas demand grow\\n-ing at 5.4 % p.a. to reach 3.8 mboe/d by 2045.

Oil is seen expanding by 3.7 % p.a., adding about 6.4 mboe/d to reach 10.8 \\nmboe/d by 2045. Coal demand grows too, but at a lower annual rate, due to the energy transition \\nand efficiency improvements in coal-powered generation. \\nOther renewables see the highest expected annual growth of just over 11% p.a., expanding from \\n0.3 mboe/d in 2020 to reach 3.6 mboe/d by 2045, as India looks to further decarbonize energy sys\\n-tems and electrify the transport sector. With current installed renewables capacity of about 100 \\nGW, India plans to reach a target of 450 GW of renewable power capacity by 2030. \\nTraditional biomass is experiencing marginal growth in India, tempered by the effects of LPG \\npenetration and improved clean energy for cooking. Biomass is, therefore, expected to grow by a \\nsmall 0.4% p.a. over the outlook period. \\nFor comparison, Figure 2.3 illustrates regional growth patterns for the OECD and non-OECD by \\nfuel type, which underscores some significant differences. Firstly, it is noticeable that the non-\\nOECD dominates demand requirements with growth in all energy sources, with the exception \\nof coal. In the OECD, both coal and oil see declines on the back of environmental policies and \\nimproving efficiencies, and the growth of gas is limited. Coal, and to some extent gas, are see\\n-ing their market share in electricity generation shift to renewables in the OECD, especially in \\nOECD Europe.\\nFigure 2.3\\nGrowth in energy demand by fuel type and region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.3\\nmboe/dŒ15Œ10Œ505101520253035OilCoalGasNuclearHydroBiomassOtherrenewablesmboe/dOECDNon-OECDTotal2.3 Energy demand by fuel\\n2.3.1 OilThe global COVID-19 pandemic, the subsequent economic downturn and the various lockdowns \\nand mobility restrictions across the world resulted in an unprecedented oil demand decline in \\n2020. Measured on an energy content basis, global oil demand fell by 8.8 mboe/d, compared to \\n2019 levels. In fact, oil was by far the most impacted primary fuel. \\n66In 2021, however, the situation has changed somewhat. The second and third waves of infections at the \\nend of 2020 and into 2021 affected most countries, albeit with varying intensity. Mobility restrictions \\ncontinued in many countries and regions, especially during the first half of the year. Nevertheless, \\nthe roll out of vaccines and a drop in infection rates during the 2Q21, especially in developed regions, \\nsaw a gradual easing of lockdown measures leading to a recovery in economic activity and increased \\nmobility. This also had a positive effect on oil demand, which has rebounded significantly in 2021.\\nDespite the demand recovery, it is not expected that primary oil demand will fully recover to 2019 lev\\n-els in 2021. The WOO sees demand growth of around 5.5 mboe/d in 2021, with prospects for the recov\\n-ery to continue in 2022, and potentially 2023. Lower incremental demand growth is expected in the \\nfollowing years, with global demand for oil-based products forecast to reach 94.5 mboe/d in 2025, rep\\n-resenting an overall increase of almost 12 mboe/d between 2020 and 2025 (Table 2.7 and Figure 2.4).\\nTable 2.7\\nOil demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nShare\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045OECD Americas\\n18.6\\n21.1\\n20.3\\n18.9\\n17.2\\n15.7\\nŒ3.0\\nŒ0.7\\n22.5\\n15.8\\nOECD Europe\\n11.1\\n11.9\\n11.1\\n10.2\\n9.3\\n8.5\\nŒ2.6\\nŒ1.1\\n13.5\\n8.6\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n6.5\\n6.8\\n6.3\\n5.7\\n5.1\\n4.6\\nŒ1.9\\nŒ1.4\\n7.9\\n4.7\\nOECD\\n36.3\\n39.8\\n37.7\\n34.8\\n31.6\\n28.7\\nŒ7.5\\nŒ0.9\\n43.9\\n29.0\\nChina\\n12.6\\n14.5\\n15.1\\n15.4\\n15.6\\n15.6\\n3.1\\n0.9\\n15.2\\n15.8\\nIndia\\n4.4\\n5.8\\n7.1\\n8.4\\n9.7\\n10.8\\n6.4\\n3.7\\n5.3\\n10.9\\nOPEC\\n7.8\\n9.1\\n10.0\\n10.7\\n11.2\\n11.6\\n3.9\\n1.6\\n9.4\\n11.7\\nOther DCs\\n16.9\\n19.7\\n21.7\\n23.5\\n25.2\\n26.7\\n9.8\\n1.920.4\\n27.0\\nRussia\\n3.1\\n3.5\\n3.5\\n3.5\\n3.5\\n3.4\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n3.7\\n3.4\\nOther Eurasia\\n1.6\\n2.0\\n2.1\\n2.1\\n2.1\\n2.1\\n0.5\\n1.0\\n2.0\\n2.1\\nNonŒOECD\\n46.3\\n54.6\\n59.6\\n63.8\\n67.3\\n70.3\\n24.0\\n1.7\\n56.1\\n71.0\\nWorld\\n82.5\\n94.5\\n97.3\\n98.6\\n98.9\\n99.0\\n16.5\\n0.7\\n100.0\\n100.0\\nSource: OPEC.\\nBeyond 2025, global growth in primary oil demand is anticipated to decelerate. During the period \\n2025Œ2035, global incremental demand is forecast in the range of around 4 mboe/d, while almost \\nno growth is projected for the last ten years of the forecast period.\\nOverall, primary oil demand is set to increase in the long-term from 82.5 mboe/d in 2020 to 99 \\nmboe/d in 2045. This represents an increase of 16.5 mboe/d. As already noted, however, more than \\n70% of this growth is expected to materialize during the first five years of the forecast period, largely \\nrelated to the demand recovery from the large 2020 decline.\\nDespite decelerating oil demand growth in the second part of the forecast period and strong \\ngrowth in other energy sources, such as other renewables, gas and nuclear, oil is expected to \\nretain the highest share in the global energy mix during the entire timeframe (Table 2.1). In 2020, \\noil accounted for 30% of global energy requirements. Alongside the oil demand recovery, the share \\nof oil is anticipated to gradually increase to a level of more than 31% by 2025, before it begins a \\ndecline to reach around 28% by 2045.\\nA review of the major drivers underlying the outlook for future oil demand, including sectoral \\ndevelopments and demand for specific oil-based products, is presented in Chapter 3. In this \\n67Figure 2.4\\nOil demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.5\\nIncremental oil demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nrespect, it is also important to note that the figures shown in this chapter are not directly compa\\n-rable with those shown in other chapters. \\nThere are two main reasons for this. Firstly, Chapter 2 uses energy equivalent units (mboe/d) to \\nallow for a comparison between the different fuel types. In other chapters, however, oil is expressed \\nin volumetric units (mb/d). Secondly, the definition of oil in Chapter 2 is different from that used in \\nChapters 3 to 6. While Chapter 2 deals with primary energy sources, other chapters consider the \\noutlooks for all liquid fuels. In that sense, in this chapter, biofuels is considered as biomass, coal-to-\\nliquids (CTLs) as coal and gas-to-liquids (GTLs) as gas, but they are all part of the liquids outlook in \\nChapter 3 to 6. Moreover, a gradual shift in the demand structure towards lighter products leads to \\nhigher volumes, even without increasing demand, if measured on an energy content basis. \\nFigure 2.5 provides an overview of the major trends at the regional level. The largest incremen\\n-tal oil demand is forecast to come from Other Developing countries. Driven by strong population \\nFigure 2.4\\nmboe/d020406080100120202020252030203520402045mboe/dOECDChinaIndiaOPECOther non-OECDFigure 2.5\\nmboe/dOECDAmericasŒ4Œ2024681012OtherDCsIndiaOPECChinaEurasiaOECD AsiaOceaniaOECDEuropeOECDAmericasmboe/d68growth, fast expanding economies, further urbanization and the related expansion of the middle \\nclass, this large group of countries has incremental oil demand in the range of almost 10 mboe/d \\nover the forecast period. Similar trends also apply to India and OPEC Member Countries in which \\ncorresponding increments are in the range of 6 mboe/d and 4 mboe/d, respectively.\\nSome oil demand growth is also projected for China and Eurasia. However, demand in these coun\\n-tries will likely mature over the current decade and thereafter enter a relatively long period of pla\\n-teauing. Thus, the demand increase in China is forecast to be just slightly above 3 mboe/d, while \\nthe overall increase in Eurasia is less than 1 mboe/d.\\nIn terms of OECD countries, oil demand in this group is marked by a short period of strong growth \\non the back of a recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, before entering a long \\nperiod of slow, but steady decline. The largest demand decline is projected for OECD Americas, \\nat a negative 3 mboe/d, followed by OECD Europe with a drop of 2.6 mboe/d and then OECD Asia \\nOceania with a decline of 1.9 mboe/d. Contrary to most non-OECD countries, the prevailing fac\\n-tors driving the demand decline in the OECD are the substitution of oil by electricity and natural \\ngas in various sectors of consumption, technology driven efficiency improvements, adopted policy \\nmeasures, demographics and consumer-led developments. \\nIt is important to note that Figure 2.5 uses 2020 as the basis for the calculation of incremental oil \\ndemand over the forecast period. Depending on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific \\ncountries and regions, this calculation could either amplify the contribution of countries/regions \\nto future oil demand or ‚hide™ part of the real demand decline over the forecast period. For exam\\n-ple, if the basis for comparison were pre-pandemic demand levels in 2019, overall demand growth \\nin India would be at 5.9 mboe/d, instead of the 6.4 mboe/d presented in Figure 2.5, and the overall \\ndemand decline in the OECD would stand at 12.5 mboe/d, instead of the reported 7.8 mboe/d. In \\nthis case, the global growth number would change to 7.7 mboe/d.\\n2.3.2 CoalDemand for coal accounts for 26.5% of total global energy demand, which is equivalent to almost \\n73 mboe/d (Figure 2.6). However, the COVID-19 pandemic has hit many coal companies hard, and \\nthe ongoing drive to reduce CO\\n2 emissions, political pressure and policies focused on the phasing \\nout of coal powered plants, with gas and renewables substituting, and the retirement of many old \\nplants, is impacting demand considerably. \\nThe downward trend for global coal demand has accelerated during the pandemic and targeted \\npolicies for a transition toward cleaner energy sources is further placing restrictions on coal \\nconsumption.\\nCoal consumption in the US, which peaked in 2005, has faced a dramatic decline over the past dec\\n-ade, especially from 2015 onwards. Coal-fired plants have been replaced by cheaper natural gas \\nand renewables, investments have been reduced, and despite efforts by the previous US admin\\n-istration to support the industry, demand has continued to decline. The policies of the new US \\nadministration are expected to impact the coal sector even deeper.\\nMedium- to long-term coal demand is forecast to drop meaningfully across all OECD regions. This \\nis most dramatic in OECD Europe, where it falls by 5.5% p.a. over the forecast period, which brings \\ndown coal™s share in the energy mix from 12% to nearly 3%. The decline rate in the entire OECD \\nregion is about 2.6% p.a. \\nIndia is the second largest importer of coal and among the few countries where demand for coal \\nwill continue to rise, alongside the increasing use of renewables and nuclear. The share of fos\\n-sil fuels in India™s total energy demand is still strong, with coal at nearly 44%. With the country \\n69growing rapidly in terms of electricity requirements, the need to expand energy access, and given \\nthe fact that energy demand per capita is relatively low, coal is expected to play a key role in meet\\n-ing India™s electricity demand growth.\\nIndia™s coal use is forecast to increase by 2.4% p.a. from 2020Œ2045 (Table 2.8), with coal con\\n-sumption increasing from 7.6 mboe/d to almost 14 mboe/d by the end of forecast period. It should \\nbe noted, however, that the share of coal in India™s total energy demand is expected to shrink, as \\nnuclear, gas and other renewables increase their shares. \\nFigure 2.6\\nCoal demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.6\\nmboe/d01020304050607080202020252030203520402045mboe/dOECDChinaIndiaOther non-OECDTable 2.8\\nCoal demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nShare\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045OECD Americas\\n5.4\\n5.2\\n4.5\\n3.8\\n3.3\\n2.8Œ2.6\\nŒ2.6\\n7.4\\n4.6\\nOECD Europe\\n4.1\\n3.4\\n2.6\\n1.91.4\\n1.0\\nŒ3.1\\nŒ5.5\\n5.6\\n1.6\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n4.6\\n4.4\\n4.2\\n3.9\\n3.7\\n3.4\\nŒ1.2\\nŒ1.2\\n6.2\\n5.5\\nOECD\\n14.0\\n13.1\\n11.2\\n9.6\\n8.3\\n7.2\\nŒ6.8\\nŒ2.6\\n19.2\\n11.7\\nChina\\n39.8\\n39.9\\n37.3\\n33.5\\n30.2\\n27.6\\nŒ12.1\\nŒ1.4\\n54.6\\n45.1\\nIndia\\n7.6\\n9.4\\n10.9\\n12.4\\n13.4\\n13.8\\n6.1\\n2.4\\n10.5\\n22.5\\nOPEC\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nŒ0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\nOther DCs\\n7.5\\n8.0\\n8.4\\n8.7\\n9.1\\n9.6\\n2.1\\n1.0\\n10.3\\n15.7\\nRussia\\n2.3\\n2.3\\n2.1\\n1.91.7\\n1.5\\nŒ0.7\\nŒ1.5\\n3.1\\n2.5\\nOther Eurasia\\n1.7\\n1.8\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.4\\nŒ0.2\\nŒ0.5\\n2.3\\n2.3\\nNon-OECD\\n58.9\\n61.4\\n60.5\\n58.3\\n56.1\\n54.1\\nŒ4.8\\nŒ0.3\\n80.8\\n88.3\\nWorld\\n72.9\\n74.4\\n71.7\\n67.9\\n64.4\\n61.3\\nŒ11.7\\nŒ0.7\\n100.0\\n100.0\\n70The strong growth in India™s power sector includes ambitious targets for additional renewable \\nelectricity, which may affect the future of coal and limit its growth while a small number of new \\nthermal power plants are planned for construction in the coming years.\\nChina is the largest producer and consumer of coal, with 60% of its total energy demand coming \\nfrom this source. However, coal™s dominant position is set to shrink. China™s economy and indus\\n-trial activities are gradually recovering from the lockdown impacts of COVID-19, with rising capac\\n-ity utilization of both thermal and coking coal mines and government support, such as the special \\ngreen pass for coal transits within country. However, it can be projected that coal imports in China \\nwill continue to decline due to restrictions and political pressures to support local production. \\nIn the medium-term, China™s coal demand is expected to slow to a plateau, and in the longer-term \\nit is expected to see a significant drop. It falls from a 2025 level of nearly 40 mboe/d to less than \\nthe average global drop of 0.7% p.a.\\nThe medium- and especially the long-term future of coal will be driven by the evolution of poli\\n-cies, fiscal measures and the flow of public investments for financing new or existing coal pro\\n-jects, especially within key consumers, such as China, Japan, South Korea and India. It is impor\\n-tant to note, however, that the negative impact of COVID-19, and its financial and economic \\nconsequences, could see some countries relax policies and restrictions on coal consumption.\\n2.3.3 Natural gas\\nGas demand y-o-y, mostly in power generation and industry, dropped by more than 1.5% in 2020 \\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent declining economic activity. This was less than ini\\n-tially expected, partly due to the swift demand recovery in Asia and the cold weather in the north\\n-ern hemisphere in 4Q20. \\nAs a result of declining demand, global natural gas spot prices dropped dramatically and were \\ntemporarily at levels around $2/Million British Thermal Units (Mbtu) in late spring and the early \\nsummer of 2020, with regional spreads virtually disappearing. This led to production declines, as \\nwell as shut-ins of some LNG production, mostly in the US. \\nNevertheless, demand started recovering in 3Q20, driven by Asia, mostly China, but also other \\ncountries, such as India. Further support came from cold weather in the northern hemisphere, \\nwhich boosted demand in Europe and North America too. The upward trend continued in 2021 \\nwith demand supported by the further reopening of economies, as well as cold spring weather in \\nEurope and China. Natural gas prices recovered with Asian spot prices climbing to $12/Mbtu and \\nEuropean gas prices reaching $10/Mbtu in mid-June 2021. \\nThe gas price rally continued during summer 2021 with spot gas prices reaching levels above $16/\\nMbtu in Europe and close to $18/Mbtu in Asia in August 2021. This was due to several reasons, \\nincluding continuing strong Asian demand, a temporary drop in Russian deliveries to Europe, \\nlower LNG supplies from several countries and tight European gas storage ahead of the winter \\nseason.Natural gas demand is expected to continue growing in the medium- to long-term, in line with \\nexpanding economies and rising energy demand. This includes the increasing use of gas in power \\ngeneration and industry (including non-energy use). In line with efforts to reduce carbon foot\\n-prints and to tackle the issue of local air pollution, natural gas, as already noted, is also expected \\nto substitute for coal in power generation and industry. \\nIn total, gas demand is expected to increase by around 21.5 mboe/d between 2020 and 2045 (Figure \\n2.7). This brings total gas demand to 85.7 mboe/d in 2045, thus becoming the second largest fuel \\n71in the energy mix. Consequently, the share of natural gas in the energy mix increases from around \\n23% to almost 24.5% between 2020 and 2045.\\nHowever, this year™s outlook for 2045 has been revised down by around 5.5 mboe/d, compared \\nto last year™s WOO. This is due to the increasing number of energy polices supporting renewa\\n-bles Œ including financial/fiscal subsidies Œ and stated carbon neutrality commitments of sev\\n-eral large consuming countries/regions, which are likely to affect natural gas demand in the \\nlong-term. \\nThese policies and commitments are also supported by cost reductions related to renewables, \\nsuch as solar and wind. In some regions, renewable projects, for example, large solar PV or \\nonshore wind, are already more competitive relative to combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants \\non a full-cost basis, even without subsidy support. Future expectations point at further cost reduc\\n-tions for renewables, which are likely to improve their competitive position relative to natural gas. \\nIn addition, the investment push for renewable hydrogen, as well as biogas, is expected to lower \\ngas demand in industry, where decarbonization is not easy. \\nFinally, the future of LNG in marine bunkers remains uncertain for the time being, as some have \\nvoiced doubt about its long-term sustainability in view of CO\\n2 emission reduction targets and have \\ncalled for the increasing use of renewable hydrogen or ammonia instead. Consequently, some \\norders of LNG-fuelled vessels have been cancelled amid these concerns. \\nAt the regional level, the majority of the gas demand increase is set to come from non-OECD coun\\n-tries, which increases by 20.5 mboe/d from 2020Œ2045, with the largest increments in China and \\nIndia. In China, gas demand is expected to double to 10 mboe/d by 2045, driven by economic growth, \\nincreasing energy and electricity demand, higher industrial demand and rising levels of urbaniza\\n-tion. Furthermore, efforts to achieve peak GHG emissions by 2030 are expected to give additional \\nsupport to gas relative to coal in the generation mix. This is related not only to power generation, \\nbut also to the residential and commercial sector, where gas is likely to replace coal and LPG.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.7\\nNatural gas demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nFigure 2.7\\nmboe/d505254565860626466680102030405060708090100202020252030203520402045%mboe/dEurasiaOther DCsOPECIndiaChinaOECDShare non-OECD (RHS)72India™s natural gas demand is projected to increase by 2.8 mboe/d to 3.8 mboe/d in 2045, almost \\ntripling over the forecast period. India is actively promoting the role of gas in the energy mix with \\nan official target of 15% by 2030, from a current share of around 6%. This is in line with objec\\n-tives to reduce air pollution and affects sectors, such as power generation, residential, as well as \\nthe transportation sector, for example with the expanding network of CNG stations. In order to \\nincrease the availability of natural gas, India is expanding its gas network, raising the gasification \\nrate and supporting competition in the market. \\nA significant demand increase in gas is also expected in the OPEC region, which rises by around \\n4 mboe/d to almost 12.5 mboe/d over the forecast period. Several OPEC Member Countries are \\nseeking to increase the share of natural gas in their power generation sector, as well as for water \\ndesalination projects. Increasing gas consumption is also favoured due to the availability of gas \\nin these countries at relatively competitive price levels. Furthermore, some countries are also \\nplanning to explore the possibilities of blue hydrogen production from natural gas, some of which \\nwould be destined for export markets.\\n Gas demand in Other Developing countries is projected to increase by nearly 9 mboe/d, led by \\nemerging economies in the Asia-Pacific. Power generation and industry are the main sectors driv\\n-ing this. Furthermore, some countries, such as Vietnam, are looking to reduce the share of coal in \\nthe energy mix giving further support for natural gas in the long-term. Several countries in Latin \\nAmerica and the Asia-Pacific also see gas as a solution for small-scale LNG in power generation. \\nThe availability of competitive gas supplies in some countries in the Middle East, Africa and Latin \\nAmerica also favours its use in the long-term. \\nIn Russia, where gas is the dominant fuel in the energy mix, demand is expected to decline by \\naround 1 mboe/d between 2020 and 2045. The drop in gas demand is based on the significant \\npotential for energy efficiency measures in the power and heat generation sector. At the same \\ntime, gas consumption in the Other Eurasia region is set to expand by around 1 mboe/d, supported \\nby industrial and residential demand.\\n Gas demand in OECD regions is anticipated to increase by 1 mboe/d from 2020Œ2045, reaching \\nlevels close to 30 mboe/d at the end of the forecast period. OECD Americas is the region that is \\nexpected to see significant demand growth of 2.2 mboe/d, supported by the continuous replace\\n-ment of coal in power generation. The high availability of gas at competitive price levels is another \\nsupporting factor in this region. \\nIn OECD Asia Oceania, gas demand is seen stable between 2020 and 2045. The support for gas \\ndemand again comes from the substitution of coal in the generation mix, in countries such as \\nAustralia, Japan and South Korea. At the same time, energy efficiency measures and a push for \\nrenewable hydrogen are expected to offset some of the growth potential in this region. \\nFinally, as shown in Table 2.9, OECD Europe is projected to see declining gas demand throughout \\nthe outlook period, dropping by 1.2 mboe/d to just above 7 mboe/d in 2045. The EU Green Deal and a \\nnumber of energy policies at the national level are expected to lead to the substitution of natural gas \\nin various sectors. This includes replacement by renewables in power generation, complemented \\nby rising energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, several countries have announced significant \\ninvestments into renewable hydrogen, which may also be blended into gas pipelines and can limit \\ngas usage in industrial applications. The residential and commercial sector is also set to see the \\ndeclining utilization of gas, partly due to energy policies, some of which foresee an end of gas-fired \\nheating in the residential sector, or a phasing out of subsidies for gas heating systems. All these \\nmeasures are expected to contribute to a long-term decline in gas consumption in OECD Europe.\\nIn line with efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of natural gas, several companies including \\nShell, TotalEnergies, Mitsui and Gazprom have started offering so-called carbon-neutral LNG \\n73Table 2.9\\nNatural gas demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nShare\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045OECD Americas\\n16.8\\n18.0\\n18.2\\n18.5\\n18.7\\n19.0\\n2.2\\n0.5\\n26.2\\n22.1\\nOECD Europe\\n8.3\\n8.4\\n8.2\\n7.9\\n7.5\\n7.1\\nŒ1.2\\nŒ0.6\\n13.0\\n8.3\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n3.5\\n3.5\\n3.5\\n3.6\\n3.6\\n3.6\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n5.5\\n4.2\\nOECD\\n28.6\\n29.9\\n30.0\\n30.0\\n29.9\\n29.7\\n1.0\\n0.1\\n44.7\\n34.6\\nChina\\n5.0\\n6.7\\n8.1\\n9.1\\n9.8\\n10.1\\n5.1\\n2.87.9\\n11.8\\nIndia\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.6\\n3.2\\n3.8\\n2.85.4\\n1.6\\n4.5\\nOPEC\\n8.5\\n9.4\\n10.5\\n11.4\\n12.1\\n12.4\\n3.9\\n1.5\\n13.2\\n14.4\\nOther DCs\\n10.0\\n11.3\\n13.2\\n15.2\\n17.1\\n18.8\\n8.8\\n2.5\\n15.6\\n21.9\\nRussia\\n7.9\\n7.7\\n7.5\\n7.4\\n7.2\\n6.9\\nŒ1.0\\nŒ0.5\\n12.3\\n8.0\\nOther Eurasia\\n3.0\\n3.3\\n3.5\\n3.8\\n3.9\\n4.0\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n4.7\\n4.7\\nNonŒOECD\\n35.5\\n39.8\\n44.9\\n49.5\\n53.4\\n56.0\\n20.5\\n1.8\\n55.3\\n65.4\\nWorld\\n64.2\\n69.8\\n74.8\\n79.5\\n83.2\\n85.7\\n21.6\\n1.2\\n100.0\\n100.0\\ncargoes (on a spot basis), with several cargoes already delivered to customers.

The use of tra\\n-ditional biomass and organic matter also increased in lower income countries, as the economic \\nstress resulting from a drop in the residual income of many in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast \\nAsia, compelled a return to cheaper solid biomass from clean cooking fuels. \\nBiomass is increasingly being viewed as an important component of the energy transition, driven \\nby policies and government-led initiatives, advancements in technology, fuel-flexibility and environ\\n-mental credentials. Growth is seen in CHP generation, heating, bio-gasification, and other end-use \\napplications, as well as in transport fuels in OECD Europe and OECD Americas, specifically giving \\nthe increasing Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates in the US. \\nGlobal biomass demand is set to grow at 1.2% p.a. over the forecast period to reach 37 mboe/d \\n(Table 2.12). This represents close to a 10% share of global primary energy demand by 2045. Both \\nthe OECD and non-OECD deploy biomass as part of clean energy initiatives, as well as for energy \\nsupply security, access and affordability. \\nThe OECD continues the development of advanced biomass for the transport sector and the deploy\\n-ment of bioenergy for cogeneration in CHP units. The region is set to increase biomass demand \\nby an additional 3.3 mboe/d over the 2020Œ2045 period, with growth mainly in OECD Europe and \\nOECD Americas, but OECD Asia Oceania sees some expansion too. By 2045, biomass in OECD \\nprimary energy demand is projected to reach about 9.9%, a significantly higher share than coal. \\nMost biomass resources in developed regions are part of clean energy deployments. Bioenergy \\nand organic waste in developed nations are also being utilized in heating, and as components for \\ntransport fuels. \\nFor the non-OECD, the main biomass growth centres are China and India, as well as Other \\nDeveloping countries. It is expected that non-OECD biomass demand expands by an additional \\n6.4 mboe/d to reach 26.9 mboe/d by 2045, with most growth attributed to China, India and Sub-\\nSaharan Africa.\\n78Figure 2.11 depicts evolving biomass trends and regional distributions, which underscores that \\nbiomass is focused mostly in non-OECD regions. Over the forecast period, however, the share of \\nnon-OECD in global biomass falls from 75.3% in 2020 to below 73 % by 2045. This is mainly attrib\\n-utable to further urbanization in both India and China, given increasing electricity connections and \\nthe expansion of clean fuels for cooking.\\nIndia™s renewable energy roadmap includes a national biofuel policy that mandates greater expan\\n-sion of biofuels and other bioenergy components including biogases. China™s 14th FYP includes \\nthe development of bioenergy for energy security and as a vital component for low-carbon fuels as \\nit targets an 18% reduction in carbon intensity to attain a carbon peak by 2030.\\nTable 2.12\\nBiomass demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nShare\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045OECD Americas\\n2.83.0\\n3.2\\n3.5\\n3.7\\n4.0\\n1.3\\n1.5\\n10.2\\n10.9\\nOECD Europe\\n3.4\\n3.7\\n4.1\\n4.4\\n4.8\\n5.1\\n1.8\\n1.7\\n12.3\\n13.8\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n0.60.7\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.9\\n0.3\\n1.6\\n2.2\\n2.4\\nOECD\\n6.7\\n7.4\\n8.1\\n8.7\\n9.4\\n10.0\\n3.3\\n1.6\\n24.7\\n27.1\\nChina\\n2.6\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n4.0\\n4.3\\n4.6\\n2.0\\n2.3\\n9.4\\n12.4\\nIndia\\n3.6\\n3.7\\n3.8\\n3.9\\n3.9\\n4.0\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n13.2\\n10.7\\nOPEC\\n2.5\\n2.6\\n2.7\\n2.82.82.9\\n0.4\\n0.7\\n9.1\\n7.9\\nOther DCs\\n11.4\\n12.3\\n13.1\\n13.9\\n14.6\\n14.7\\n3.2\\n1.0\\n41.9\\n39.6\\nRussia\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n3.1\\n0.61.0\\nOther Eurasia\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.2\\n2.1\\n1.0\\n1.2\\nNon-OECD\\n20.5\\n22.1\\n23.6\\n25.1\\n26.4\\n26.9\\n6.4\\n1.1\\n75.3\\n72.9\\nWorld\\n27.2\\n29.4\\n31.7\\n33.8\\n35.7\\n37.0\\n9.7\\n1.2\\n100.0\\n100.0\\nFigure 2.11\\nBiomass demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.11\\nmboe/d0510152025303540202020252030203520402045mboe/dOther non-OECDOPECIndiaChinaOECD792.3.7 'Other renewables'\\nInvestment in renewables has expanded significantly in recent years. The Frankfurt School-UNEP \\nCentre/BNEF reported that in 2019 the amount of new renewable power capacity added (exclud\\n-ing large hydro) was the highest ever, at 184 GW, 20 GW more than in 2018. This included 118 GW \\nof new solar systems, and 61 GW of wind turbines. \\nThe trend for global investment in renewables continued during 2020 despite the pandemic, lock\\n-downs and disruptions to supply chains. This was the result of a focus on the energy transition, \\ntoward a more affordable and sustainable energy system and net zero emission reduction targets.\\nTechnological advancements, economies of scale, improved efficiencies and supply chain man\\n-agement, the energy transition and policy developments have shifted the dial for renewables, par\\n-ticular wind and solar, and improved their cost competitiveness against other forms of energy in \\nrecent years. However, grid connectivity, storage and electricity transmission over long distances \\nremain challenges in most regions. Figure 2.12 demonstrates the expected regional expansion for \\nother renewables.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.12\\n'Other renewables' demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nFigure 2.12\\nmboe/d0510152025303540202020252030203520402045mboe/dOther non-OECDOPECIndiaChinaOECDChina is the global backbone of renewables investment and additional capacity. According to the \\ncountry™s National Energy Administration (NEA), China installed more than 48 GW of new solar capac\\n-ity and 72 GW for wind in 2020. This is the highest ever yearly growth and nearly triple 2019 levels. \\nFurther renewables expansion in China is expected in the coming decades, with wind set to be \\nthe key driver in the country™s long-term carbon neutral plan. Other renewables are forecast to \\nremain the fastest growing source of energy in China with demand growth of nearly 7% p.a. from \\n2020Œ2045. This will result in an additional 8.5 mboe/d of demand in absolute terms over the fore\\n-cast period. The contribution of other renewables in China™s energy mix is set to increase from 3% \\nto 13.5% by 2045. \\n India, with its expected massive increase in electricity demand, is another engine of promotion for \\nother renewables and its government has ambitious development plans and timelines. However, \\n80regulatory issues, grid connectivity, and supply chain challenges due to COVID-19, with China \\nthe supplier of many raw materials, have proven problematic and capacity expansion plans have \\nrecently run behind schedule. \\nDespite these challenges, however, India will see a robust demand increase for power, and has \\nthe advantage of government policy support and investment plans running into hundreds of bil\\n-lions dollars over the medium- to long-term. It is projected that demand for other renewables in \\nIndia will rise by over 11% p.a. between 2020 and 2045, which results in more than 3 mboe/d of \\nadditional demand in the country™s overall energy mix. As a result, the share of other renewables \\nin India™s total energy demand is forecast to increase from 1.5% in 2020 to close to 9.6% in 2045.\\nOECD countries are also a key player in other renewables. The region accounted for nearly 47% \\nof global demand for other renewables in 2020 and is projected to witness 5.7% growth p.a. from \\n2020Œ2045. It is expected that OECD Americas will lead this demand growth in absolute terms, \\nfollowed by OECD Europe, although OECD Asia Oceania is set to see the largest p.a. expansion on \\na percentage basis. \\nIn recent years some OPEC Member Countries have also invested heavily in other renewables, \\nespecially solar and wind, which has supported the demand increase for these clean sources of \\nenergy. \\nDemand for energy generated from other renewables is forecast to increase massively in non-\\nOECD countries, from a current level of 3.6 mboe/d to 24 mboe/d by 2045. This translates to a \\ngrowth rate of 7.9% p.a. and a rise in the share of these countries in global demand for other \\nrenewables from 53.3% to 65.5%.\\nGlobally, demand for other renewables (Table 2.13) is projected to expand from 6.8 mboe/d in \\n2020 to 36.6 mboe/d in 2045. Consequently, other renewables are the fastest and largest source \\nof growth over the forecast period. The average global growth rate of 7% p.a. is above the aver\\n-age pace of development in the OECD, near the rate for China, although much below that of India.\\nTable 2.13\\n'Other renewables' demand by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nShare\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045OECD Americas\\n1.2\\n1.92.7\\n3.6\\n4.5\\n5.6\\n4.4\\n6.4\\n17.4\\n15.3\\nOECD Europe\\n1.6\\n2.2\\n3.0\\n3.5\\n4.1\\n4.6\\n3.0\\n4.4\\n23.1\\n12.6\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n0.4\\n0.7\\n1.1\\n1.6\\n2.0\\n2.4\\n2.0\\n7.3\\n6.2\\n6.6OECD\\n3.2\\n4.8\\n6.8\\n8.7\\n10.6\\n12.6\\n9.5\\n5.7\\n46.7\\n34.5\\nChina\\n2.0\\n3.5\\n5.3\\n7.1\\n8.7\\n10.5\\n8.5\\n6.9\\n29.6\\n28.8\\nIndia\\n0.3\\n0.61.0\\n1.7\\n2.5\\n3.6\\n3.4\\n11.1\\n3.8\\n9.9\\nOPEC\\n0.0\\n0.3\\n1.1\\n2.1\\n3.4\\n4.3\\n4.3\\n25.2\\n0.2\\n11.7\\nOther DCs\\n1.3\\n2.0\\n2.9\\n3.9\\n5.2\\n4.0\\n2.84.7\\n18.9\\n11.0\\nRussia\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.7\\n0.7\\n18.8\\n0.1\\n1.8\\nOther Eurasia\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.3\\n0.5\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n12.8\\n0.62.3\\nNon-OECD\\n3.6\\n6.510.6\\n15.3\\n20.6\\n24.0\\n20.4\\n7.9\\n53.3\\n65.5\\nWorld\\n6.8\\n11.3\\n17.4\\n24.0\\n31.2\\n36.6\\n29.8\\n7.0\\n100.0\\n100.0\\n81\\n2.4 Energy related CO\\n2 emissions\\nDownward revisions to primary energy demand for all fossil fuels incorporated in this Outlook, \\ncompared to the WOO 2020, results in lower energy-related emissions than anticipated a year \\nago. This starts already with a declining level of global CO\\n2 emissions in 2020, given the economic \\ndownturn and COVID-19 containment measures that led to lower demand for coal, gas and oil, \\nduring the year. Consequently, energy-related emissions declined by around 2 billion tonnes (bt) \\nin 2020, the largest annual emissions decline ever recorded (Figure 2.13).\\nFigure 2.13\\nAnnual change in energy related CO\\n2 emissions, 1950Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nHowever, part of this decline will be offset in 2021 as energy demand gradually recovers. The con\\n-tinuation of the recovery process in the years thereafter is expected to result in a further increase in \\noverall CO\\n2 emissions, albeit, with a clear growth deceleration. Moreover, emissions are expected \\nto stabilize in the range of 35 bt towards the end of the current decade and then start declining dur\\n-ing the last ten years of the forecast period. In absolute terms, as presented in Table 2.14, global \\nenergy-related emissions are projected at 34.4 bt by 2045, around 2 bt higher than in 2020. \\nTurning to specific fuels, coal-related CO\\n2 emissions were at a level of 14.9 bt in 2019. Emissions \\ndeclined sharply to 14.2 bt in 2020 and, despite a projected partial recovery in coal demand over \\nthe next two-to-three years, related emissions are expected to remain below 2019 levels. After the \\nshort-term revival in coal demand, emissions related to coal use are projected to start declining \\nsystematically to fall to around 14 bt in 2030, and further to below 12 bt by 2045.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nTable 2.14\\nEnergy-related annual CO\\n2 emissions by energy source, 2020Œ2045\\n202020252030203520402045Coal14.214.514.013.212.511.9Oil11.212.813.213.413.513.3Gas6.97.58.08.58.99.2Energy-related emissions\\n32.434.835.235.234.934.4billion tonnes\\nFigure 2.13\\nmboe/dŒ2.5Œ2.0Œ1.5Œ1.0Œ0.500.51.01.52.019501955196019651970197519801985199019952000200520102015202020252030203520402045bt82Emissions related to the use of oil are projected to reach a level of 13.3 bt by 2045, around 2 bt \\nhigher than in 2020. It needs to be emphasized, however, that oil demand was depressed signifi\\n-cantly during 2020, thus, pushing down the basis for the comparison. This is also reflected in the \\nprojection that 1.6 bt, or almost 75%, of this increase will take place before 2025 as part of the \\nrecovery process. Beyond 2025, some growth is still projected until around 2035, before emissions \\nstabilize within a narrow range of 13.2Œ13.5 bt. There is then expected to be a marginal decline \\ntowards the end of the forecast period.\\nCO2 emissions related to gas demand are anticipated to be on a rising trajectory over the forecast \\nperiod, increasing from almost 7 bt in 2020 to more than 9 bt in 2045. This is a reflection of the \\nexpected strong demand growth for this energy which, after other renewables, is forecast to be the \\nsecond largest contributor to incremental demand in the period to 2045. \\nLooking at emissions from the regional perspective, annual CO\\n2 emissions for major regions are \\nprovided in Figure 2.14. Emissions in most developing countries will continue growing through\\n-out the forecast period on the back of expanding energy needs. Correspondingly, emissions in the \\ngroup of ‚Other non-OECD™ countries (non-OECD countries without China and Eurasian countries) \\nare expected to grow from 9.2 bt in 2020 to 15.1 bt in 2045. However, part of this growth will be off\\n-set by emissions reduction in China, Eurasia and the OECD. \\nFigure 2.14\\nEnergy-related annual CO\\n2 emissions by region, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.14\\nmboe/d05101520253035402019202020252030203520402045billion tonnesOECDChinaEurasiaOther non-OECDEmissions reductions in all three of these regions is mainly driven by the strong demand decline \\nfor coal which, in the case of OECD countries, is supplemented by declining oil demand. The larg\\n-est emissions reduction is projected for the OECD, at Œ2.3 bt between 2020 and 2045, followed by \\nChina (Œ1.5 bt) and Eurasia (Œ0.1 bt). In fact, total energy related emissions in Eurasia are expected \\nto remain in a very narrow range of 2.6Œ2.7 bt throughout the forecast period, hence, it has little \\nimpact on the overall pattern.\\nIt has to be emphasized, however, that comparing emission trends on an absolute weight basis \\nonly provides one-half of the picture. It is equally important to look at these trends on a per cap\\n-ita basis as presented in Figure 2.15. From this perspective, the pattern for Developing countries \\n83Figure 2.15\\nPer capita CO\\n2 emissions by region, 2020 and 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.15\\nmboe/d0123456798OECDDCsEurasiatonnes20202045Figure 2.16\\nCumulative CO\\n2 emissions since 1900, 1990Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.16\\nmboe/d02004006008001,0001,2001,400199019952000200520102015202020252030203520402045billion tonnesAnnex INon-Annex Ichanges from growing emissions on an absolute weight basis to a very stable, even a slight \\ndecline, on a per capita basis. Moreover, per capita emissions in OECD countries were almost \\nthree times higher than those for Developing countries in 2020 and, despite a significant decline \\nin OECD countries, they are still forecast to be more than twice as high in 2045. A similar disparity \\nexists when comparing Eurasia and Developing countries.\\nAnother important aspect of the emissions discussion relates to historical cumulative CO\\n2 emis-sions. These are presented in Figure 2.16 from the perspective of Annex I and Non-Annex I coun\\n-tries. This figure clearly demonstrates that there is a substantial gap in cumulative emissions \\n84between these two groups of countries that has evolved throughout the past century. In 2000, \\ncumulative emissions from Annex I countries were at around 770 bt, 3.5 times higher than those \\nfrom Non-Annex I that stood at around 220 bt. \\nOver the past 20 years, the gap has started to narrow on the back of rapid energy demand growth \\nin many developing countries and this trend is expected to continue over the forecast period. \\nDespite this, even by the end of the forecast period, historical cumulative emissions by Non-Annex \\nI countries will be more than 150 billion tonnes of CO\\n2 lower than those generated by Annex I coun\\n-tries since 1900.\\n2.5 Energy intensity and consumption per capita\\nLockdown measures implemented across most the world in 2020, with some also in 2021, have \\nreduced global energy consumption and GHG emissions significantly. Some observed facts during \\nthe pandemic are worth highlighting: residential demand increased compared to commercial and \\nindustrial; the energy consumption from private cars declined during lockdowns, and then wit\\n-nessed a sharp increase as these were eased; and, electricity consumption in buildings at the dis\\n-trict level increased, whereas thermal energy fell. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has also \\nestablished new work and living practices, which some suggest may become the new normal and \\noutlast the pandemic. It is not all one way either, with some developments potentially seeing a \\nrise in energy use, for example, an increasing preference for cars over public transport in a post-\\nlockdown and post-pandemic world.\\nFigure 2.17 highlights the outlook foreseen for energy intensity in specific developing countries and \\nregions. A general assertion that can be made in analyzing energy intensity patterns is that in most \\nregions the amount of energy required to produce one unit of GDP continues to drop, despite the \\neconomic shock resulting from the pandemic. The world is moving toward a more social, and envi\\n-ronmental conscious paradigm that is contributing to the rendering of products and services in a \\nmore sustainable and efficient manner. In most regions, energy efficiency advances are expected to \\naccompany technological developments, with steady progress, if not acceleration, envisaged.\\nFigure 2.17\\nEvolution and projections of energy intensity in major world regions, 1990Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nmboe/dboe/$1,000 (PPP 2017)OECDIndiaChinaOPECEurasiaOther DCsWorldFigure 2.17\\n0123419901995200020052010201520202025203020352040204585India and China are forecast to continue to see further improvements in their energy intensity over \\nthe projected period. In developed regions, technological progress and the increasing number of \\nenergy-efficiency policies in all economic sectors support a decoupling between energy use and \\neconomic growth, and this is expected to persist in these regions. This year™s WOO sees a more \\npronounced and steep downward pattern in many regions due to the change made in the GDP \\n(PPP) base year. This is now 2017 for this Outlook, instead of 2011 that was used last year, which \\noffsets the forecasted energy demand reduction. \\nOther Eurasia and Russia have followed a similar downward energy intensity pattern since 1990. \\nThe OPEC region is not expected to start seeing a relative energy consumption decline before \\nthe early 2040s. Energy intensities across developing regions are expected to move towards \\nconvergence, as previously wide gaps in energy intensities are gradually eliminated. The world \\nis experiencing a slowdown in obtaining energy efficiency performances and may not see a dou\\n-bling of the rate of improvement Œ as targeted by SDG 7.3 Œ before the early 2040s.\\nThe forecast for energy efficiency performance across the major regions is summarized in Figure 2.18. \\nThis year™s Outlook shows an increased energy intensity rate in many regions. This is explained by the \\nchange made in the GDP (PPP) base year to 2017 and regional efforts in energy savings. Energy effi\\n-ciency for most sectors, in both the OECD and non-OECD regions, will continue to advance, outpac\\n-ing improvements achieved in the past 25 years, despite the economic shock related to COVID-19. \\nChina and India are expected to realize the fastest and largest reductions in energy intensity, on aver\\n-age 3.21% p.a. and 2.85% p.a., respectively, between 2020 and 2045. The OECD is likely to achieve an \\nestimated reduction of 1.85% p.a. Other regions will experience an estimated reduction in the range \\nof 0.89% to 1.59% p.a., whereas the global average reduction is projected to be at a level of 2.06% p.a.\\nAnother vitally important global issue to highlight is energy poverty. Although the COVID-19 pan\\n-demic has hit the drive from global policymakers to reduce energy poverty, the general trend \\nin recent years has been that the number of people suffering from energy poverty has been in \\ndecline. Figure 2.18\\nAverage annual rate of improvement in global and regional energy intensity, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.18\\nmboe/dŒ3.5Œ3.0Œ2.5Œ2.0Œ1.5Œ1.0Œ0.50OECDChinaIndiaOPECOther DCsEurasiaWorld%86The gap between energy consumption per capita in the OECD and non-OECD regions is forecast to \\nnarrow slightly. However, besides all the efforts made to bridge the gap, the average consumption \\nin the OECD region is still many times higher than that in developing countries. \\nSince then, however, rapid economic expansion in the developing world, particularly in developing Asia, \\nhas helped lift millions of people out of poverty, expand the middle class, and enable an increase in \\nenergy access. In 2015, average energy consumption in non-OECD countries had almost tripled com\\n-pared to 1970 levels and the gap with the OECD had lessened. Nevertheless, the gap is still wide and \\nenergy poverty remains an extremely important and urgent global issue for policymakers to resolve.\\nFrom the energy demand perspective, Figure 2.19 shows that variances in average per capita \\nenergy consumption (in a very broad sense, a proxy to energy poverty/wealth) can be linked to \\n differences in the level of development and, therefore, to average income levels.\\nFigure 2.19\\nEnergy consumption per capita \\nversus\\n GDP at PPP per capita, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 2.19\\nmboe/d01020304050607005101520253035GDP per capita ($1,000 PPP) Energy consumption per capita (boe)OECDChinaIndiaOPECOther DCsEurasiaWorld20452020This Outlook anticipates that energy consumption in the non-OECD region will remain broadly \\nlinked with rapid economic growth. This will help bring an increase in electrification, a rise in \\nurbanization levels, an expansion in the middle class and enable rising income levels. This is \\nclearly apparent for the two most populous Asian economies: China and India. \\nIn the former, average per capita energy consumption is expected to rise, increasing from around \\n16.7 boe in 2020 to 20 boe in 2045. In the latter, average consumption is anticipated to move from \\na level of 4.6 boe in 2020 to around 8.5 boe by 2045. During the medium-term (2020Œ2025), India is \\nset to have the highest energy growth rate followed by China, at 3.4% and 1.8%, respectively. For \\nother developing countries, in general, both per capita income and consumption is expected to \\nremain at low levels, despite the significant increase in energy demand in absolute terms.\\nDespite anticipated modest economic growth, the OECD region Œ where economies are more ser\\n-vice-oriented Œ are set to see energy consumption per capita continue to decline, a trend that began \\nin 2004. The level of 28.1 boe observed in 2020 is forecast drop to 26.8 boe by 2045. The projected \\noutlook for the OECD region continues to envision a decoupling of GDP growth and energy demand, \\ndriven by technological advances and policy-driven energy efficiency improvements.\\n87Box 2.1\\nFocus on Africa\\nThe continent of Africa is home to an abundance of energy resources, including about \\n10% of the world™s oil reserves, however, it still has difficulty in harnessing these precious \\nresources to meet its energy demand. This, in turn, hinders efforts to provide affordable and \\nreliable energy required for economic growth and development.\\nThis challenging dynamic has meant that energy use per capita across the continent is below \\nthe global average. In fact, to date, there remains a huge gap in energy per capita consump\\n-tion between Africa™s rural and urban areas. \\nAfrica has yet to unlock its huge potential in the energy sector, although its ever-increasing \\npopulation growth and economic prospects require more energy. This drawback is mostly \\ndue to regional uncertainties, as well as government policies and regulatory frameworks \\nguiding the energy sector, and more recently the efficiencies required to reduce CO\\n2 emis-sions in exploration and production (E&P) activities. These challenges have made it increas\\n-ingly difficult to secure much-needed financing for E&P from foreign investors.\\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have also been a major setback, especially for those \\ncountries that depend heavily on revenue from fossil fuels for their economic growth and \\ndevelopment. The continent was severely hit by the drop in export revenues and declines in \\neconomic activity, which invariably impacted fiscal reserves.\\nIn a recent study conducted by OPEC on the medium- and long-term energy demand out\\n-look for Africa, the Reference Case from the WOO was utilized and from this, two sensitivity \\ncases were developed for higher GDP growth and lower GDP growth. The Reference Case \\nwas based on the assumption that the continent™s average annual GDP will expand from \\n 0.7 % between 2016Œ2020 to over 3.5% between 2025 and 2045. Figure 1 illustrates the GDP \\npath for the three cases over the forecast period.\\nBox 2 Figure 1\\nmboe/d11.413.716.018.305101520252015202020252030203520402045$ trillionReference CaseHigher GDP growth caseLower GDP growth caseFigure 1\\nAfrica GDP levels in the long-term, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\n88The Reference Case shows that Africa™s energy demand is expected to grow\\n significantly, with an addition of 10.8 mboe/d in the long-term compared to 2020 levels \\nof 16.6 mboe/d. Total energy demand is anticipated to increase to about 18.8 mboe/d by \\n2025 and continue rising to reach over 21 mboe/d by 2030 and 27.5 mboe/d by the end of \\nthe forecast period. \\nThe Reference Case also sees the share of biomass in primary energy demand drop from \\n46.5% in 2020 to around 34.5% in 2045. This is due to more people moving from rural to \\nurban settlements, and as they embrace a new preference towards modern cooking fuels. \\nFigure 2 illustrates the Reference Case primary energy demand outlook in Africa.\\nFigure 2\\nAfrica primary energy demand in the Reference Case\\nSource: OPEC.\\nBox 2 Figure 2\\nmboe/d0510152025302015202020252030203520402045mboe/dOilCoalGasHydroNuclearBiomassOther renewables2045The demand for oil is anticipated to grow from 2020 levels of 3.7 mboe/d to about 4.4 mboe/d \\nin 2025, and 7.3 mboe/d in 2045. Hence, the share of oil in Africa™s energy mix is fore\\n-cast to increase from 22% in 2020 to 27% by 2045. Gas demand is anticipated to rise from \\n 2.6 mboe/d in 2020 to 3 mboe/d in 2025 and then reach 5.1 mboe/d by 2045. The share of gas \\nis forecast to increase from 16% in 2020 to 19% by 2045, which is about 8% lower than the \\nshare of oil by the end of the forecast period.\\nThe higher GDP growth case assumes that the continent™s average annual GDP will expand \\nto reach 6.1% during the last five years of the forecast period. Comparing the higher GDP \\ngrowth case to the Reference Cases shows that the difference in demand for oil is about \\n 0.2 mboe/d by 2030, before increasing to reach 2.3 mboe/d by 2045. It is a similar story for \\ngas, where the results show an increase in demand from 0.1 mboe/d in 2025 to 2.4 mboe/d \\nby 2045.

The lower GDP growth case shows that all \\nsources in Africa™s energy mix are expected to decline compared to the Reference Case, \\nwith total energy at 24.3 mboe/d by 2045, which is 3.2 mboe/d less than Reference Case \\n89Figure 3\\nIncremental energy demand between Higher GDP growth and Reference Cases\\nSource: OPEC.\\nBox 2 Figure 3\\nmboe/dOilCoalGasHydroNuclearBiomassOther renewables02468101220252030203520402045mboe/dlevels.

One of the ways to finance \\nthese projects could be for governments to seek financial partnerships with the private \\nsector for the expansion of their refining and petrochemical industries.

However, almost 80% of this incremental demand is expected to \\n materialize within the first three years (2021Œ2023), primarily as part of the COVID-19 \\nrecovery process. \\nŁ Using 2019 as the base year for comparison would result in incremental demand of \\n 4.4 mb/d.Ł OECD oil demand is expected to rise by almost 4 mb/d in the period to 2026. However, \\nthis increase will not be sufficient to return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels. \\nŁ Non-OECD demand is anticipated to increase by almost 10 mb/d over the medium-term; \\naround half of this will be needed to cover the 2020 demand decline.\\nŁ Global oil demand is expected to increase by 17.6 mb/d between 2020 and 2045, rising \\nfrom 90.6 mb/d in 2020 to 108.2 mb/d in 2045.\\nŁ Long-term projections highlight a contrasting demand picture, with ongoing demand \\ngrowth in non-OECD regions and declining demand in the OECD.\\nŁ Demand growth will be at 2.6 mb/d on average during the first five years of the forecast \\nperiod. Growth will then slow significantly during the second five-year period to 0.6 mb/d \\nand further to 0.3 mb/d during the period 2030Œ2035. After that, projections indicate vir\\n-tually no growth, hinting at a relatively long period of plateauing oil demand.\\nŁ The transportation sector is set to be the major contributor to future incremental global \\noil demand, adding around 13 mb/d between 2020 and 2045. \\nŁ More than 90% of this massive demand increase is projected to come from the road \\ntransportation and aviation sectors, each contributing around 6 mb/d, though a large \\npart of these increases is due to a sharp demand decline in both sectors in 2020. \\nŁ The total vehicle fleet is expected to reach 2.6 billion by 2045, increasing by around \\n 1.1 billion from 2020 levels. The EV fleet approaches 500 million vehicles by 2045, \\n representing almost 20% of the global fleet. \\nŁ Adjusting long-term projections to the demand decline in 2020, the petrochemical sector \\nremains the largest source of incremental demand to 2045, similar to last year™s Outlook. \\nŁ With respect to refined products, major demand growth over the long-term is expected \\nfor jet/kerosene (+5.5 mb/d), diesel/gasoil (+3.3 mb/d), gasoline (+3.3 mb/d) and ethane/\\nLPG (+3.0 mb/d).94The year 2020 was both turbulent and challenging, marked with a COVID-19-related economic \\ndownturn, public health measures restricting mobility and slower construction and manufactur\\n-ing activity across the globe. This resulted in a sharp oil demand drop of almost 10 mb/d, though \\nmarket conditions started improving towards the end of 2020. Oil prices were mostly on a rising \\ntrajectory in the last quarter of 2020, supported by an expectation of demand recovery and still-\\nconstrained prospects for a stronger supply recovery.\\nIndeed, demand started its recovery path in 2021, although this will likely remain far from a full \\nrecovery, especially in the road transportation and aviation sectors. On the one hand, progress in \\nvaccination rollouts and the introduction of stimulus packages, especially in developed countries, \\nled to easing lockdown measures and supported economic activity and travelling. This, in turn, \\nresulted in a partial oil demand recovery. On the other, however, the appearance of new COVID-\\n19 variants and slower vaccination progress in many developing countries hindered full demand \\nrecovery at the global level.\\nDespite the omnipresent COVID-19 pandemic, 2021 was not just about fighting the virus. On the \\ncontrary, it was a critical year during which policymakers and the entire energy and oil industries \\nreached a crossroads, seeking direction for future developments. Many see the recent decline in \\nenergy and oil demand as an opportunity to expedite investment into renewable energy, both to \\nsupport the economic recovery and accelerate the transition to cleaner fuels. This is clearly dem\\n-onstrated by the number of countries that announced their intention to achieve net-zero emis\\n-sions sometime around 2050. \\nThis sentiment did not stop at the policymaking level. There is a clear visible shift in the strategy of \\nseveral international oil companies (IOCs), especially in Europe, where they is a tendency to diversify \\nportfolios by adding other energy sources as part of their regular activities. Car manufacturers are yet \\nanother example of companies seeking new direction. The investment structure of these companies \\nprovides a strong signal on the introduction of new models and expanding capacity to produce EVs.\\nFinally, a shift in consumer behaviour is also emerging. Tele/homeworking is becoming a norm for \\nmany companies as a result of the pandemic. Tourism started to recover slowly in 2021, but is still \\nsignificantly restricted to home and neighbouring countries rather than long-distance travel. Public \\nacceptance of more energy-efficient technologies and lower-emission solutions is also progressing.\\nDespite all these signals, many uncertainties and questions related to future oil demand remain \\nunanswered. The primary one relates to the pace of these changes. Clearly, transforming the \\nentire energy system is an extremely challenging task that will take some time. Similarly, achiev\\n-ing significant penetration of EVs in a global fleet of almost 1.5 billion vehicles (and growing) \\nwill not happen overnight. Moreover, will stimulus packages outlined by almost all governments \\nbe effective, leading to higher growth with the intended investment structure? How long will the \\nchange in consumer behaviour last, and what will remain permanent? Will people use cars the \\nsame way as before the crisis? How long will tourists refrain from travelling? Will the aviation \\nindustry return to past growth rates? \\nThe list of questions is not exhaustive, but even for those highlighted there are few clear answers \\nreadily available. This chapter tries to shed light on some of the possibilities and analyze key \\nfactors affecting the future demand path, and provide insights into the evolving outlook for oil \\ndemand in the medium- and long-term.\\n3.1 Oil demand outlook by region\\nGlobal oil demand experienced an unprecedented decline of 9.3 mb/d in 2020, primarily due to \\nCOVID-19-related lockdowns and a reduction in economic activity of 3.4% compared with 2019. \\n95Table 3.1\\nMedium-term oil demand in the Reference Case \\n20192020202120222023202420252026Growth\\n2020Œ2026OECD Americas\\n25.7\\n22.6\\n24.4\\n25.3\\n25.5\\n25.6\\n25.5\\n25.4\\n2.8\\nOECD Europe\\n14.3\\n12.4\\n13.0\\n13.4\\n13.5\\n13.4\\n13.3\\n13.2\\n0.8\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n7.8\\n7.17.4\\n7.5\\n7.6\\n7.5\\n7.4\\n7.4\\n0.3\\nOECD\\n47.7\\n42.1\\n44.7\\n46.3\\n46.6\\n46.5\\n46.3\\n45.9\\n3.9\\nLatin America\\n6.2\\n5.7\\n6.0\\n6.2\\n6.3\\n6.4\\n6.5\\n6.60.9\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n4.2\\n3.9\\n4.0\\n4.2\\n4.3\\n4.5\\n4.6\\n4.8\\n0.9\\nIndia\\n4.9\\n4.5\\n5.0\\n5.3\\n5.5\\n5.7\\n5.9\\n6.1\\n1.6\\nChina\\n13.5\\n13.2\\n14.3\\n14.8\\n15.0\\n15.2\\n15.4\\n15.6\\n2.4\\nOther Asia\\n9.0\\n8.1\\n8.6\\n8.9\\n9.2\\n9.4\\n9.6\\n9.8\\n1.6\\nOPEC\\n8.8\\n8.1\\n8.5\\n8.8\\n9.0\\n9.2\\n9.4\\n9.6\\n1.6\\nRussia\\n3.6\\n3.4\\n3.6\\n3.6\\n3.7\\n3.7\\n3.8\\n3.8\\n0.4\\nOther Eurasia\\n2.0\\n1.7\\n1.92.0\\n2.0\\n2.0\\n2.1\\n2.1\\n0.4\\nNonŒOECD\\n52.3\\n48.6\\n51.9\\n53.6\\n55.0\\n56.2\\n57.3\\n58.5\\n9.9\\nWorld\\n100.0 \\n90.6 \\n96.6 \\n99.9 \\n101.6 \\n102.7 \\n103.6 \\n104.4 \\n13.8 \\nmb/d\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLast year™s Outlook expectation was that oil demand would recover relatively swiftly, with most \\nof this taking place in 2021, and then some continuation of the recovery process in 2022 and \\n possibly 2023. \\nHowever, oil demand growth in 2021 has been slower than previously anticipated. The assessment \\nprovided in the July 2021 edition of the OPEC MOMR projected a demand increase of 6 mb/d in \\n2021. This means that 2021 demand would still be around 3.4 mb/d lower than in 2019 and almost \\n1.1 mb/d lower than projected a year ago. It is important to note that a slower-than-expected \\nrecovery took place primarily in the OECD region, where the rebound in 2021 represented less \\nthan 50% of the decline in 2020. Needless to say, this lower demand base also has some implica\\n-tions for medium- and long-term demand levels.\\nSimilar patterns also apply to the recovery process of most non-OECD countries, except for China. \\nHowever, the differences between last year™s projections and this Outlook are much smaller when \\nexamining the OECD, generally in the range of just 0.1 mb/d for most regions. The unique exception is \\nChina, for which current 2021 oil demand expectations are more than 1 mb/d higher than in the pre\\n-vious Outlook. Part of this difference (around 0.4 mb/d) is attributable to upward revisions in historic \\noil demand in China. The rest is mostly related to 2020 developments when, surprisingly, China™s oil \\ndemand was much less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic than anticipated in mid-2020 analysis. The \\nprojection at that time was for a decline of 1 mb/d. However, strong demand growth in the second half \\nof the year resulted in an annual decline of only 0.3 mb/d. The combined effect of these factors is that \\nnon-OECD demand for 2021 has been revised upward by 0.6 mb/d in this year™s Outlook.\\nThe overall downward demand revision for 2021, which now sees growth of 6 mb/d (Table 3.1), \\ncombined with assumed GDP growth of 4.1% in 2022 and prospects for containment of the COVID-\\n19 pandemic, provide the basis for a stronger recovery process extending to 2022, and possibly \\n96even to 2023. Along with robust GDP growth in 2022, this view is also supported by an ongoing \\ndemand revival, especially in the sectors most affected by the COVID-19 crisis. These include road \\ntransport, aviation and industry sectors.\\nIn the road transport and aviation sectors, an assumed improvement in the pandemic situation \\nshould result in a higher propensity to travel and fly longer distances, hence supporting demand \\ngrowth beyond the standard link to economic activity. A similar effect is also expected in the indus\\n-trial sector, where production declined significantly in 2020 and many investment decisions were \\ndeferred. These investments are likely to be listed once again in the coming years, especially with \\nsupport from government stimulus packages, which in turn supports oil demand growth in the \\nsector.\\nFor these reasons, global oil demand is set to increase by 3.3 mb/d and 1.7 mb/d in 2022 and 2023, \\nrespectively, as presented in Figure 3.1. This figure also clearly illustrates that global demand \\ngrowth will significantly decelerate after an initial period of strong growth from 2021Œ2023. Indeed, \\nannual incremental demand is expected to drop to a range of 1 mb/d during 2024 and 2025 and \\nthen well below 1 mb/d towards the end of the medium-term, when long-term factors start pre\\n-vailing that limit potential demand growth. An important element of this view is the expectation \\nthat economic growth will decelerate from a range of 3.5% to 4% p.a. in 2022 and 2023 to 3.2% to \\n3.3% p.a. for the rest of the medium-term.\\nFigure 3.1\\nAnnual incremental oil demand by region, 2020Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.1\\nmboe/dŒ12Œ10Œ8Œ6Œ4Œ2024682020202120222023202420252026OECDNon-OECDmb/dBesides lower GDP growth, a number of other factors will increasingly be at play in the second \\npart of the medium-term period that contributes to decelerating demand growth. These include \\nfurther GDP structural changes in several countries, such as China, with a higher share com\\n-ing from lower energy and oil intensity sectors. This will be supplemented by ongoing efficiency \\nimprovements and changing consumer behaviour Œ such as increasing home office working and \\nthe use of teleconferencing instead of physical travel. Another example in this direction is an \\nuptick in the sale of new cars, including a higher share of EVs, which affects both improved fuel \\nefficiency and oil substitution by non-oil based energy sources. \\n97The latter two factors Œ fuel efficiency and oil substitution Œ will also play a role outside of the \\nroad transportation sector. This is mainly due to higher electrification in residential and indus\\n-trial sectors, supported by various policy measures and higher demand for natural gas, which \\noften replaces oil products in these two sectors. Examples of such options include the City Gas \\nDistribution initiative in India, which targets the replacement of LPG and kerosene by natural gas; \\nthe reduction of direct crude burning for electricity generation in the Middle East; growing interest \\nin LNG-powered vessels in the shipping industry; and a ban on oil-based heating systems in the \\nresidential sector in several European countries (e.g. in Austria as of 2023 and the UK as of 2025).\\nThe combined effect of all these factors, with varying impacts at the regional level, will likely be an \\noverall decelerating global trend. Therefore, the global demand increase over the medium-term \\nperiod (2020Œ2026) is estimated to be 13.8 mb/d. However, almost 80% of this incremental demand \\nwill materialize within the first three years (2021Œ2023), primarily as part of the COVID-19 recovery \\nprocess. Using 2019 as the base year for comparison would result in incremental demand of 4.4 mb/d.\\nFigure 3.2 summarizes these projections from the perspective of the two major regions Œ OECD \\nand non-OECD. The typical pattern for this figure for the past several years was one of declining \\ncumulative oil demand in the OECD, which was more than offset by growing demand in the non-\\nOECD region. Due to special circumstances in the base year (2020), this pattern changes in the \\ncurrent Outlook, as both regions show significant growth.\\nFigure 3.2\\nIncremental oil demand by region, 2020Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nIn the case of the OECD, oil demand is expected to increase by almost 4 mb/d in the period to 2026. \\nHowever, this increase will not be sufficient for a return to pre-COVID-19 demand levels, as the \\npartial recovery trend until 2023 will revert to declining demand in the region for the rest of the \\nforecast period.\\nThe outlook for non-OECD demand is quite different. It is estimated to increase over the medium-\\nterm period in the range of 10 mb/d, with around half required to cover the demand decline of \\n2020. Compared with the OECD, this will be achieved relatively swiftly, sometime during 2022. As \\nFigure 3.2\\nmboe/d0246810121416OECDNon-OECDWorldmb/d98\\nmentioned earlier, demand growth will also decelerate in the non-OECD region over the medium-\\nterm period. Nonetheless, it will remain at more than 1 mb/d annually, thus driving global oil \\ndemand to 104.4 mb/d in 2026.\\nLong-term demand prospects are summarized in Table 3.2. At the global level, oil demand is \\nexpected to increase by 17.6 mb/d between 2020 and 2045, rising from 90.6 mb/d in 2020 to \\n 108.2 mb/d in 2045.Table 3.2\\nLong-term oil demand by region \\nGrowth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n25.7\\n22.6\\n25.5\\n24.6\\n22.9\\n21.0\\n19.3\\nŒ3.3\\nOECD Europe\\n14.3\\n12.4\\n13.3\\n12.5\\n11.6\\n10.6\\n9.7\\nŒ2.7\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n7.8\\n7.17.4\\n6.9\\n6.3\\n5.7\\n5.1\\nŒ1.9\\nOECD\\n47.7\\n42.1\\n46.3\\n44.0\\n40.8\\n37.3\\n34.2\\nŒ7.9\\nLatin America\\n6.2\\n5.7\\n6.5\\n7.0\\n7.3\\n7.5\\n7.8\\n2.0\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n4.2\\n3.9\\n4.6\\n5.3\\n6.0\\n6.7\\n7.4\\n3.6\\nIndia\\n4.9\\n4.5\\n5.9\\n7.2\\n8.5\\n9.8\\n11.0\\n6.5\\nChina\\n13.5\\n13.2\\n15.4\\n16.2\\n16.6\\n16.9\\n17.0\\n3.8\\nOther Asia\\n9.0\\n8.1\\n9.6\\n10.5\\n11.4\\n12.2\\n12.9\\n4.8\\nOPEC\\n8.8\\n8.1\\n9.4\\n10.4\\n11.1\\n11.6\\n12.0\\n3.9\\nRussia\\n3.6\\n3.4\\n3.8\\n3.9\\n3.9\\n3.8\\n3.7\\n0.3\\nOther Eurasia\\n2.0\\n1.7\\n2.1\\n2.2\\n2.2\\n2.3\\n2.2\\n0.5\\nNon-OECD\\n52.3\\n48.6\\n57.3\\n62.6\\n67.1\\n70.8\\n74.1\\n25.5\\nWorld\\n100.0 \\n90.6 \\n103.6 \\n106.6 \\n107.9 \\n108.1 \\n108.2 \\n17.6 \\nmb/d\\nTable 3.2 also underscores several observations worth mentioning. First, long-term projections \\nhighlight a contrasting demand picture between ongoing demand growth in the non-OECD region \\nand declining demand in the OECD. This trend will begin during the medium-term period and then \\nintensify over the longer-term. Indeed, OECD demand is projected to peak at levels of around 46.6 \\nmb/d as soon as 2023, before starting a longer-term decline towards 34 mb/d by 2045. \\nThe main reasons for this trend are efficiency improvements across all sectors of consumption \\nand the substitution of oil by gas and renewable energy. This includes the significant penetration \\nof EVs in the road transportation sector, ongoing electrification of residential and industrial sec\\n-tors and the penetration of alternative fuels in the marine and aviation sectors, among others. \\nPart of this picture includes a static (and aging) population and low economic growth, with less \\noil-intensive industry, especially in the second part of the forecast period. \\nIn contrast, demand will continue to grow in the non-OECD region, driven by an expanding mid\\n-dle class, high population growth rates and stronger economic growth potential. Oil demand in \\nthis group of countries is expected to increase by 25.5 mb/d between 2020 and 2045, to reach\\n Source: OPEC.\\n99Figure 3.3\\nAverage annual oil demand increments by region, 2020Œ2045 \\nSource: OPEC.\\n74.1 mb/d in 2045. It should be noted, however, that almost 5 mb/d of the projected demand \\nincrease in the non-OECD region will be needed just to recover the demand loss from 2020.\\nThe second observation relates to a front-loaded pattern of future demand growth. This is well \\nillustrated in Figure 3.3, which presents average annual oil demand increments during five-year \\nintervals. It clearly shows that future demand growth will be concentrated in the current decade, \\nwith quite limited growth potential thereafter.\\nDriven by the COVID-19 crisis recovery process, annual oil demand growth is forecast at 2.6 mb/d \\non average during the first five years of the forecast period. It is then expected to slow significantly \\nduring the second five-year period to 0.6 mb/d, and even more to 0.3 mb/d during the 2030Œ2035 \\nperiod. After that, projections indicate virtually no growth, hinting to a relatively long period of pla\\n-teauing oil demand at the global level. As noted earlier in this chapter, this will be a period when \\ndemand declines in the OECD will broadly offset decelerating growth in the non-OECD. This will \\nbe driven by both energy policies and technology development, which will play an increasing role \\nin diversifying the future energy mix.\\nFigure 3.3\\nmboe/dŒ1.0Œ0.500.51.01.52.02.53.02020Œ20252025Œ20302030Œ20352035Œ20402040Œ2045mb/dOECDIndiaChinaOther non-OECDWorldThe third observation is linked to the fact that current projections represent yet another downward \\nrevision to long-term global oil demand, primarily as a reflection of tightening policy measures \\naimed at reducing energy-related emissions. \\nCompared with the WOO 2020, current demand projections are broadly similar at the end of the \\nmedium-term. However, the gap starts widening thereafter, leading to a downward revision of \\naround 1 mb/d by 2045. Some contributing factors to this revision are slightly lower long-term \\nGDP growth rates and lower base demand levels, though the main reasons are assumed to be \\ngreater efficiency improvements, the higher penetration of EVs and the extended substitution of \\nrefined products by other energy sources, such as marine bunker fuel by LNG in the shipping\\n sector. The overall downward revision for this year is not large, but the cumulative effect of \\n consecutive revisions over the last three years is significant.\\n100\\n3.1.1 OECDFigure 3.4 details annual demand increments in major OECD regions over the medium-term. Oil \\ndemand in this region in 2020 declined sharply by 5.6 mb/d (Figure 3.4). As shown in Figure 3.2, \\nincremental oil demand over the medium-term is projected at just 3.9 mb/d. This means that \\nOECD oil demand is no longer expected to reach 2019 levels. On the contrary, after just three years \\nof positive growth over the 2021Œ2023 period, OECD oil demand will start declining.\\nFigure 3.4\\nAnnual oil demand growth in the OECD, 2020Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.4\\nmboe/dŒ6Œ5Œ4Œ3Œ2Œ101232020202120222023202420252026mb/dOECD AmericasOECD EuropeOECD Asia OceaniaThere are several reasons supporting this view. OECD oil demand started to recover in 2021, \\nalbeit at a relatively slow rate. The demand increase in 2021 represents less than half of the 2020 \\ndecline. A large part of this is due to the sluggish recovery in road transport. Many parts of the \\nOECD experienced local (partial) shutdowns in 2021 with strong mobility restrictions, especially at \\nthe beginning of the year. The situation has improved somewhat in the second half of the year, but \\ncross-border travelling has remained challenging. \\nThis is assumed to improve in the coming years on the back of progressing vaccination programmes, \\nbut consumer confidence and the propensity to travel will likely remain subdued for some time. This \\nis also reflected in weak new car registration data in all major OECD countries. Despite some revival \\nof new registrations in 2021 from the very low levels of 2020, they are still well below pre-COVID-19 \\nlevels. At the same time, both the total number of new EVs and their share in new registrations is \\nexpanding, especially in Europe, where the share of EVs passed the 10% mark in 2020. Adding to \\nthis, stringent fuel efficiency standards are being implemented for new vehicles in OECD countries \\nand road transport demand in OECD Asia Oceania and OECD Europe was already on the decline \\nbefore the pandemic crisis. Together, this results in an expectation that OECD oil demand in the road \\ntransport sector will not fully recover to 2019 levels (Figure 3.5).\\nThe situation is even more challenging in the aviation sector, which was hardest hit in 2020, \\nthough the longer-term expectation is that oil demand will fully recover and continue growing in \\nthis sector. OECD Europe was among the regions with the sharpest demand drop in 2020, as the \\nvast majority of aircraft were grounded for several months. Some traffic recovery started in the \\n101\\nsecond half of 2020 and is expected to continue over the medium-term period, though at a slow \\npace, as both leisure and business travel will be affected by COVID-19 measures for several years. \\nAs a result, and similar to the conclusion made in last year™s WOO, OECD oil demand in this sector \\nwill remain subdued, barely returning to the 2019 levels by the end of the medium-term.\\nIn contrast to the road transportation and aviation sectors, oil demand in the petrochemical sector \\nis expected to recover relatively swiftly from the COVID-19 crisis, driven largely by capacity addi\\n-tions in OECD Americas, especially in the US. This newly built US capacity will remain competitive \\ndue to the availability of suitable domestic feedstock, which is set to push demand higher by some \\n0.3 mb/d over the medium-term. This will offset declines in petrochemical feedstocks in OECD \\nEurope and OECD Asia Oceania, which struggle to remain competitive with other producers in Asia \\nand the Middle East. Nonetheless, growth in demand for petrochemical products will not be suf\\n-ficient to prevent OECD oil demand from shifting to a declining path.\\nBeyond the medium-term, OECD demand is set to decline as presented in Figure 3.6. The over\\n-all demand drop between 2020 and 2045 will be around 8 mb/d. By far the largest demand \\ndecline at the sectoral level is projected for road transport, where oil demand will be 6 mb/d \\nlower by 2045, compared to 2020. Almost half of this decline (Œ2.8 mb/d) will materialize in \\nOECD Americas, followed by OECD Europe (Œ2.2 mb/d) and OECD Asia Oceania (Œ1.2 mb/d). The \\ntwo main factors, almost equally contributing to this demand decline, are the fast penetration of \\nEVs into the OECD fleet and efficiency improvements for new ICE vehicles. Moreover, changes \\nin driving habits leading to lower mileage driven per vehicle are anticipated to further exacer\\n-bate the demand decline. \\nContrary to road transport, oil demand in the aviation sector is projected to increase in the long-\\nterm. As already discussed, demand in this sector will struggle to recover from the 2020 col\\n-lapse in the medium-term. However, once the recovery phase is over and consumers regain con\\n-fidence, demand is anticipated to continue growing. Overall incremental demand is expected at \\n 2.3 mb/d between 2020 and 2045. However, almost 2 mb/d of this will be compensation for the \\n2020 demand decline and only around 0.3 mb/d will be required to provide fuels for additional \\n aviation activity compared with 2019.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.5\\nOil demand growth in the OECD by sector, 2020Œ2026\\nFigure 3.5\\nmboe/dŒ4Œ3Œ2Œ1012RoadAviationPetrochemicalsOther sectorsmb/d2019Œ20202020Œ2026102\\nThe long-term path for OECD oil demand in the petrochemical sector will be somewhere between \\nthe road transport and aviation sectors. OECD demand in this sector rebounded fairly quickly after \\ndropping in 2020 and is projected to grow until around 2030. This growth will primarily be driven \\nby favourable conditions in the US on the back of growing tight oil production and available steam-\\ncracking capacity. This, however, will change after tight oil production peaks towards the end of \\nthe current decade and starts to decline for the rest of the forecast period.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.6\\nOECD oil demand by sector, 2019Œ2045 \\nFigure 3.6\\nmboe/d0102030405020192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045RoadAviationPetrochemicalsOther sectorsmb/dIn the other two OECD regions, oil demand in the petrochemical sector is set to start declining \\nmuch earlier than in OECD Americas. The main reason is a competitive disadvantage against fast-\\ngrowing capacity in Asia and the Middle East, which will already play a role in the medium-term \\nand then more over the longer-term. The net effect of these trends is that OECD oil demand in the \\npetrochemical sector will be broadly at 2020 levels by 2045.\\nFrom the oil demand perspective, developments in other sectors (including industrial, residential, \\ncommercial and electricity generation) will be marked by oil replacement through natural gas and \\nelectricity as a result of various policy measures. Tighter building codes, the partial exclusion of \\noil-based heating systems from the residential and commercial sectors, emissions-trading sys\\n-tems in the industrial sector and oil substitution in electricity generation are just a few exam\\n-ples of mechanisms steering the demand decline. Moreover, the implementation of more efficient \\ntechnology will play a role in further reducing OECD oil demand.\\n3.1.2 Non-OECDSimilar to the OECD trend, oil demand sharply declined in non-OECD regions during 2020, \\nalthough the extent of the decline was lower in both absolute and relative terms. Non-OECD \\ndemand declined by 3.7 mb/d in 2020, though a large part of this is projected to recover in 2021, \\nwhen demand is set to increase by 3.3 mb/d, suggesting that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic \\non oil demand in this region will be short-lived. However, a closer look at Figures 3.7 and 3.8 high\\n-light some interesting perspectives.\\n103\\nFigure 3.8\\nOil demand change compared to 2019, 2020Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.7\\nAnnual oil demand growth in non-OECD countries, 2020Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.8\\nmboe/dŒ4Œ3Œ2Œ1012345672020202120222023202420252026IndiaChinaOther AsiaOPECOther non-OECDmb/dIt is evident that exceptionally high demand growth in China in 2021 and 2022 will compensate for weak \\ndemand performance in other regions. Indeed, according to the July 2021 edition of the OPEC MOMR, \\ndemand in China declined by 0.3 mb/d in 2020 and is set to increase by 1.1 mb/d in 2021, representing \\none-third of overall non-OECD demand growth. Strong demand growth in China will also continue in \\n2022, before decelerating to much smaller annual increments towards the end of the medium-term.\\nA different demand pattern is projected for India, where demand growth in 2021 will just broadly \\ncompensate for losses in 2020. This is mainly because of the challenging pandemic situation in \\nFigure 3.7\\nmboe/dŒ4Œ3Œ2Œ1012342020202120222023202420252026IndiaChinaOther AsiaOPECOther non-OECDmb/d104\\nIndia, with the country struggling to contain the COVID-19 virus in the first half of 2021. As seen in \\nFigure 3.8, it means that China and India will be the only two countries/regions (in the Outlook™s \\nregional breakdown) with higher demand in 2021 than 2020.\\nThis stands in stark contrast to other non-OECD regions, where the oil demand recovery in 2021 \\nwill only be in the range of 40%Œ60% of the 2020 decline. Moreover, demand in these regions will \\nlikely be below 2019 levels even during 2022 and will only move into positive territory in 2023. \\nAfter that, demand growth is expected to continue for the rest of the medium-term on the back \\nof robust and relatively stable GDP growth in the region. This will be in the range of 4.6% to 4.7% \\np.a. on average for developing countries and around 2% p.a. for the Eurasian region. Therefore, \\nnon-OECD demand growth will remain in the range of 1.1 mb/d to 1.2 mb/d p.a., with a margin\\n-ally decelerating trend.\\nThe overall effect of these regional trends is that non-OECD demand is set to increase by almost \\n10 mb/d between 2020 and 2026. Figure 3.9 shows how this growth is distributed between regions \\n(including OECD regions for ease of comparison), together with the corresponding average annual \\ndemand growth rate. In the first case, where 2020 serves as a basis for comparison, all regions Œ \\nincluding within the OECD Œ are projected to record positive and in most cases significant demand \\ngrowth. In fact, the largest growth would come from OECD Americas, where demand declined most \\nin 2020. This is followed by China, India, Other Asia and OPEC, with each contributing between 1.5 \\nmb/d to 2.5 mb/d to incremental medium-term demand.\\nThis picture changes substantially, however, if the basis for comparison is 2019. In this case, \\nChina becomes the major contributor to incremental demand, followed by India, OPEC and Other \\nAsia. What also changes is the order of magnitude of these components. Only the demand contri\\n-bution of China remains relatively stable by shifting the base year. All other regions decline quite \\nsignificantly, including OECD regions, which revert to negative growth if pre-pandemic levels are \\nconsidered as a base for comparison. \\nFigure 3.9\\nRegional oil demand growth\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.9\\nmboe/dOther non-OECDChinaIndiaOther AsiaOPECMiddle East & AfricaLatin AmericaRussiaOther EurasiaOECD AmericasOECD Asia OceaniaOECD EuropeChinaIndiaOther AsiaOPECMiddle East & AfricaLatin AmericaRussiaOther EurasiaOECD AmericasOECD Asia OceaniaOECD EuropeŒ3Œ2Œ10123456Œ1.5Œ1.0Œ0.500.51.01.52.02.53.0%% average growth p.a.

In this respect, Figure 3.9 \\nshows that the fastest demand growth is projected for India, which is around 1 pp higher than in \\nother fast-growing regions. Moreover, although not presented in the figure, demand growth in \\nChina is set to rapidly decelerate, while growth in India, Other Asia, OPEC and the Middle East and \\nAfrica remains robust for a longer period.\\nTherefore, incremental demand in these regions will be higher (except for the Middle East & \\nAfrica because of the low demand base) than that of China in the long-term (see Table 3.2). The \\nlargest demand increase over the forecast period (2020Œ2045) is projected to come from India at \\n 6.5 mb/d, followed by Other Asia (4.8 mb/d), OPEC (3.9 mb/d) and China (3.8 mb/d). This also \\nshows that the future centre of gravity of global oil demand will shift significantly towards non-\\nOECD Asian countries.\\nIndiaA detailed discussion of major trends and key factors driving future oil demand in India is provided \\nin Chapter 9. Thus, analysis in this section is limited to high-level observations. \\nAs presented in Table 3.2, India is projected to be the country with the highest oil demand growth \\nand largest incremental demand over the forecast period. The primary reason for this is projected \\ndemand expansion in the road transportation sector, and supported by a demand rise in the resi\\n-dential, industrial and aviation sectors (Figure 3.10). \\nDemand growth in road transportation will by driven by a rising middle class segment of the popu\\n-lation leading to a rapid expansion of the vehicle fleet and infrastructure. The total number of vehi\\n-cles in India is set to increase by more than 200 million between 2020 and 2045 from less than 50 \\nmillion (except two-wheelers) in 2020 to almost 250 million in 2045. As a result, oil demand in road \\ntransportation alone is forecast to increase by 3.8 mb/d during the forecast period.\\nDemand additions in other sectors are set to be in a significantly lower range. Combined demand \\nin the residential, commercial and agricultural sectors is anticipated to grow by around 0.8 mb/d \\nFigure 3.10\\nmboe/d0123456Road transportationAviationRail/waterwaysMarine bunkersPetrochemicalsOther industryResid./Comm./Agr.Electricity generationmb/d 2020202520352045106\\nFigure 3.11\\nOil demand by product in India, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.11\\nmboe/d024681012202020252030203520402045Ethane/LPGNaphthaGasolineJet/keroseneDieselFuel oilOther productsmb/dbetween 2020 and 2045. The next largest increase is projected for the petrochemical sector at \\n 0.7 mb/d, followed by ‚other industry™ at 0.6 mb/d and the aviation sector at 0.5 mb/d.\\nDemand trends at the sectoral level also determine the future breakdown of specific refined prod\\n-ucts. These are presented in Figure 3.11. The largest demand increase during the entire forecast \\nperiod is projected for diesel at 2.5 mb/d, on the back of the robust growth of commercial vehi\\n-cles, industry and the agricultural sector. Since gasoline is the preferred fuel for passenger cars, \\nits demand in India is projected to increase by around 1.7 mb/d until 2045. A large part of the resi\\n-dential sector growth will be linked to the use of LPG. Its total demand in India is set to increase \\nby 0.7 mb/d. Growth in the aviation and petrochemical sectors will result in increased demand for \\njet kerosene (0.5 mb/d) and naphtha (0.5 mb/d). \\nDemand growth in the same range is also projected for the group of ‚other products™ (0.6 mb/d) \\nsuch as bitumen, pet coke, lubes/greases and waxes. Most of these products are used to expand \\nthe road network, as refinery fuels and to produce energy-intensive goods such as cement, alumin\\n-ium and steel. Finally, demand for residual fuel oil is set to remain in a narrow range of 0.1 mb/d to \\n0.2 mb/d during the entire forecast period, since there are no major international bunkering hubs in \\nIndia and the electricity sector is dominated by the use of coal, renewables and natural gas.\\nChinaAs mentioned in earlier parts of this chapter, China™s oil demand is set for exceptionally high \\ngrowth of 1.1 mb/d in 2021 after declining by 0.3 mb/d in 2020. However, this high growth Œ \\n supported by massive governmental investment Œ is not expected to be sustained. On the contrary, \\ndemand growth in China is expected to decline below 0.5 mb/d by 2022, with sustained annual \\nincrements of between 0.2 mb/d and 0.3 mb/d for the rest of the medium-term.\\nThis trend is projected to continue in the long-term, with annual increments falling below 0.1 mb/d \\nsometime after 2030 and virtually reaching no growth towards the end of the forecast period. This \\nis clearly presented in Figure 3.12, which provides a breakdown of China™s oil demand in major \\nconsumption sectors. It shows that future demand growth in China will be driven mainly by the \\n107\\nFigure 3.12\\nOil demand in China by sector, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nroad transportation, petrochemical and aviation sectors. Some growth is also projected for the \\nresidential and agricultural sectors, as well as in rail and domestic waterway transport modes.\\nOverall demand changes in China will largely depend on what happens in its road transport sector. \\nThe car market in China is among the most dynamic markets in the world and currently also the \\nlargest in terms of new sales. The size of the passenger vehicle fleet in China is projected to more \\nthan double, rising from about 185 million cars in 2020 to around 464 million in 2045. However, \\na significant part of the potential demand growth resulting from this impressive increase in fleet \\nsize will be offset by improved average efficiencies, as well as fuel substitution through electri\\n-fication and natural gas. Combined, there is set to be around 150 million alternative vehicles on \\nChinese roads by 2045, leading to much slower growth in oil demand by then. Despite this, road \\ntransportation in China will account for around 45% of overall demand growth Œ 1.7 mb/d of a total \\n3.8 mb/d of incremental demand Œ between 2020 and 2045. \\nUsing 2020 as the base year, the aviation sector is the second-largest contributor to long-term \\ndemand growth in China, adding 0.9 mb/d between 2020 and 2045. However, almost 0.4 mb/d of \\nthis incremental demand relates to the demand decline of 2020, which will be recovered over the \\nmedium-term. Demand growth in this sector will continue in the long-term, however, similar to \\nroad transport, growth will gradually slow. \\nThe petrochemical industry in China is expected to contribute to future demand growth at levels \\ncomparable to the aviation sector Œ around 0.8 mb/d over the forecast period. A large part of this \\nexpansion will be naphtha-based (+0.6 mb/d), supplemented by ethane and LPG. In comparison \\nto the previous two highlighted sectors, however, the petrochemical industry is likely to be on a \\ngrowth trajectory, even at the end of the forecast period.\\nAt the other end of the spectrum are electricity generation and the industrial sector. Oil plays a \\nminor role in China™s power sector, mostly fuelling diesel aggregates for special purposes, and \\nthis will not change significantly in the years to come. In the industrial sector (other than petro\\n-chemicals), China™s gradual departure from energy-intensive industries is also set to result in a \\nslow decline in oil demand over the long-term.\\nFigure 3.12\\nmboe/d6mb/d012345678Road transportationAviationRail/waterwaysMarine bunkersPetrochemicalsOther industryResid./Comm./Agr.Electricity generationmb/d 2020202520352045108\\nOther non-OECD regions\\nOther Asia is the second-largest contributor to future oil demand. Consisting of several coun\\n-tries with high population growth, such as Indonesia, Philippines and Vietnam, rising urbanization \\nand a growing middle class, this region is projected to experience robust economic growth in the \\nperiod to 2045. This, in turn, provides strong support for oil demand growth, especially in the first \\nhalf of the forecast period, as the road transportation, petrochemical and aviation sectors expand. \\nThe largest incremental demand is projected in road transportation (2.3 mb/d) on the back of \\ngrowing numbers of both passenger cars and commercial vehicles. The petrochemical and avia\\n-tion sectors are set to add another 0.9 mb/d and 0.8 mb/d, respectively.\\nThe specifics of Other Asia include a high share of marine bunkers in total demand due to the \\npresence of large bunkering ports in the region. Projected growth in marine shipping in this region \\nwill likely offset expected efficiency improvements and some shift to LNG, so that demand for \\nmarine bunkers increases by 0.5 mb/d.\\nOPEC countries are also expected to play an important role in shaping future oil demand. \\nCumulative oil demand in these countries is set to increase by around 4 mb/d between 2020 and \\n2045, of which 0.7 mb/d will relate to demand recovery after 2020. Similar to other developing \\ncountries, road transportation will be the main source of this increase, contributing 1.7 mb/d to \\nfuture growth (Figure 3.13). \\nSpecific to OPEC, particularly in the Middle East, is large incremental demand growth in the petro\\n-chemical industry, which is projected to be almost at parity with road transportation. Strong growth \\nin this sector is expected in the medium-term, as several large petrochemical projects come on \\nstream in Saudi Arabia, IR Iran and the UAE. Finally, some demand growth is also set to take place \\nin the aviation and marine bunkers sectors. However, overall demand increases in these sectors is \\nforecast to be limited to a range of 0.2 mb/d for marine bunkers and 0.5 mb/d for the aviation sector.\\nThe range of projected demand growth in the \\nMiddle East & Africa\\n is comparable to that of China \\nand OPEC, standing at 3.6 mb/d during the entire forecast period. However, considering the rel\\n-atively low demand base in 2020, the Middle East & Africa (excluding OPEC Member Countries) \\nis the second-fastest growing region in relative terms (2.6% p.a. on average), just behind India. \\nHowever, given the very dynamic demographic developments in Africa, its rich endowment of \\nFigure 3.13\\nOil demand in OPEC by sector\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.13\\nmboe/d024681012142019202020252030203520402045RoadAviationOther transportPetrochemicalsOther sectorsElectricity generationmb/d109\\nnatural resources, still relatively low urbanization and high potential for improvements in labour \\nproductivity, growth is still below the continent™s potential.\\nAround half of the region™s incremental demand is projected to take place in road transportation, \\n1.8 mb/d over the entire forecast period, followed by the residential/commercial sector (0.5 mb/d) \\nand aviation (0.4 mb/d). Contrary to other regions, oil use for electricity generation is set to con\\n-tinue expanding in the Middle East & Africa, adding almost 0.4 mb/d to incremental demand. A \\nclear indication of higher potential demand growth in this region is the petrochemical industry, \\nwhere oil demand is currently less than 0.1 mb/d. It is expected to more than double over the fore\\n-cast period, but due to a low base, even by 2045 it will only be slightly above 0.1 mb/d.\\nAverage GDP growth in \\nLatin America\\n is projected to stay in the range of 2Œ2.5% p.a. for most of \\nthe forecast period, although it declines to below 2% towards the end. This will likely put a cap on \\noil demand growth. Overall demand is projected to increase by 2 mb/d between 2020 and 2045, out \\nof which around 0.5 mb/d is due to a demand drop in 2020.\\nFrom the sectoral perspective, growth is mainly driven by road transportation at 0.7 mb/d. \\nRelatively high increments are projected for the residential and agricultural sectors which, com\\n-bined, will add another 0.4 mb/d to future demand. Demand in the aviation and industrial sectors \\nis set to grow by around 0.3 mb/d each. \\nDemand growth in the remaining two regions Œ \\nRussia and Other Eurasia\\n Œ is projected at significantly \\nlower levels. The combined demand change for these two regions is around 0.8 mb/d between 2020 \\nand 2045. Out of this, however, more than 0.5 mb/d will be needed just to reach pre-pandemic lev\\n-els, which leaves 0.3 mb/d for future growth. Moreover, oil demand in these regions will only slightly \\nexpand till around 2035, before it plateaus ins in Other Eurasia and marginally declines in Russia.\\n3.2 Oil demand outlook by sector\\nThis section highlights major trends in sectoral oil demand in the Reference Case. It starts with \\nissues regarding the key transportation sector, including road transportation, aviation, rail and \\ndomestic waterways, as well as marine bunkers. This is followed by a review of key trends in the \\nindustrial sector, which comprises petrochemicals and other industry. Finally, the evolving oil \\ndemand pattern in the remaining sectors Œ including residential, commercial, agricultural and \\nelectricity generation Œ is highlighted. \\nTable 3.3 and Figure 3.14 summarize oil demand trends at the global level in these sectors. \\nCurrently, around 56% of global oil demand, or more than 54 mb/d, comes from various forms of \\ntransportation. This is still slightly below the pre-pandemic years, as road and aviation transport \\nwere severely affected by COVID-19. Nevertheless, demand is expected to be restored in these two \\nsectors over the medium-term, pushing the share back to almost 58% in 2025. It is expected to \\nremain in a very narrow range of 57Œ58% for the rest of the forecast period. \\nThis does not mean, however, that all transportation modes will retain their share over the long-\\nterm. On the contrary, a fairly stable share of oil demand in the transportation sector is set to \\nresult from the offsetting effect of growing demand in the aviation and marine bunker sectors and \\nan inverted cup shape demand in the road transportation sector.\\nThe transportation sector is forecast to be the major contributor to future incremental demand, \\nadding around 13 mb/d to global oil demand between 2020 and 2045. More than 90% of this mas\\n-sive demand increase is projected to come from the road transportation and aviation sectors, \\nwith each contributing around 6 mb/d, although a large part of these increases will be due to the \\n recovery from the sharp demand declines experienced in these two sectors in 2020.\\n110\\nSome demand growth is also projected in the industrial sector, driven by strong demand for \\npetrochemical products, though the magnitude of this increase is much lower compared with \\nthe transportation sector. The overall demand change in the industrial sector is forecast to be \\n 4.9 mb/d, of which 4.3 mb/d relates to petrochemical feedstock. Demand growth in the petrochem\\n-ical industry represented the single-largest contributor to incremental oil demand in the past few \\nOutlooks. Technically, this is not the case in this year™s Outlook, as both the road transportation \\nTable 3.3\\nSectoral oil demand, 2019Œ2045\\nGrowth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045Road\\n44.6\\n40.0\\n46.3\\n46.5\\n46.4\\n46.2\\n46.2\\n6.3\\nAviation\\n6.7\\n3.5\\n7.17.6\\n8.3\\n8.8\\n9.3\\n5.8\\nRail/waterways\\n1.91.8\\n2.0\\n2.0\\n2.1\\n2.1\\n2.0\\n0.2\\nMarine bunkers\\n4.2\\n3.9\\n4.3\\n4.5\\n4.6\\n4.6\\n4.6\\n0.7\\nTransportation\\n57.3\\n49.2\\n59.6\\n60.7\\n61.4\\n61.8\\n62.2\\n13.0\\nPetrochemicals\\n13.7\\n13.0\\n14.8\\n15.9\\n16.5\\n16.9\\n17.3\\n4.3\\nOther industry\\n12.9\\n12.7\\n13.1\\n13.5\\n13.7\\n13.4\\n13.3\\n0.6Industry\\n26.6\\n25.7\\n27.8\\n29.4\\n30.2\\n30.3\\n30.5\\n4.9\\nResid./Comm./Agr.\\n11.1\\n10.9\\n11.4\\n12.0\\n12.0\\n12.0\\n11.6\\n0.7\\nElectricity generation\\n4.9\\n4.9\\n4.7\\n4.5\\n4.3\\n4.0\\n3.9\\nŒ1.0\\nOther uses\\n16.1\\n15.8\\n16.2\\n16.5\\n16.3\\n16.0\\n15.5\\nŒ0.3\\nWorld\\n100.0\\n90.6\\n103.6\\n106.6\\n107.9\\n108.1\\n108.2\\n17.6\\nmb/d\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.14\\nOil demand growth by sector, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.14\\nmboe/dDemand in 2020Growth intransportationGrowth in industryGrowth in other sectorsDemandin 204590.6108.280838689929598101104107110mb/dRoad 6.3Other 0.9Aviation 5.8Petrochemicals 4.3Other industry 0.6Electricity gen. Œ1.0Resid./ Comm./Agr. 0.7111and aviation sectors are projected to grow by larger volumes. This change, however, is only due to \\nspecific developments related to COVID-19 in 2020, which is the base year for comparison in this \\nWOO. Adjusting these figures for the demand decline in 2020, the petrochemical sector actually \\nremains the largest source of incremental demand to 2045. \\nThe other part of industrial demand Œ covering mainly iron, steel and cement production, along \\nwith mining and construction Œ is projected to grow during the current decade before a plateau \\nis reached sometime around 2035. Moreover, growth rates during the first half of the projection \\nperiod are forecast to be much lower than for petrochemicals. This is mainly due to a number \\nof fuel substitution options, primarily by natural gas and electricity. This is particularly the case \\nin the OECD regions, where oil demand in this sector will generally be on a declining trajectory, \\nexcept for the initial years after 2020, when revived economic activity will push the industrial use \\nof oil slightly higher.\\nIn the case of non-OECD countries, oil demand in ‚other industry™ will result from an interplay of \\nseveral factors. Robust GDP growth in these countries is often tightly linked to industrialization. \\nHowever, competition between oil, gas and electricity will also play a role by partly offsetting the \\npotential demand growth linked to economic activity. This will be further affected by efficiency \\nimprovements and gradual structural changes in the economies of these countries as the ser\\n-vice sector share rises, especially towards the end of the forecast period. In some countries, such \\nas China, this is already clearly present and will be fostered further in the years to come. The net \\neffect of these counter-balancing trends is that the global demand increase in the ‚other industry™ \\nsector is only forecast to be 0.6 mb/d between 2020 and 2045. The demand decline over the year \\n2020 also plays a role. \\nCombined, the residential, commercial and agricultural sectors account for around 12% of total \\noil demand. At the global level, similar to ‚other industry™, demand in this sector is projected to \\ngrow by around 1 mb/d during the next 10Œ15 years and then decline by around 0.5 mb/d by the \\nend of the forecast period. This overall pattern results from varying trends between the major \\nregions. \\nStrict policy measures, especially for building codes and heating systems, combined with elec\\n-trification and fuel substitution, is expected to cause OECD demand in this sector to slowly, \\nalbeit steadily, decline during the current decade. This trend will accelerate over the second \\npart of the forecast period as even tighter policy measures push demand lower. The demand \\ndifference between 2020 and 2045 is projected to be 1.4 mb/d. However, strong growth in the \\nnon-OECD region, especially India, China and Africa, is anticipated to offset demand losses \\nin the OECD and result in net growth of 1.3 mb/d in the period to 2035. Demand growth in the \\nnon-OECD region will decelerate during the remaining part of the forecast period, which, com\\n-bined with declining demand in the OECD, is set to lead to an overall demand increase of around \\n 0.7 mb/d by 2045. \\nFinally, electricity generation is the only sector in which demand is forecast to decline, a result of \\nincreasing competition from natural gas and renewables. The overall loss is projected at 1 mb/d \\nbetween 2020 and 2045.\\nFigures 3.15 and 3.16 provide a summary of sectoral demand changes from the perspective \\nof major regions. Shifting the base year for comparison to 2020, with its exceptionally low oil \\ndemand, alters the magnitude of demand changes compared with last year™s Outlook. In the case \\nof the OECD, oil demand is projected to decline for the period 2020Œ2045 in all major sectors \\nexcept for aviation and petrochemicals. The largest demand drop is projected for road transporta\\n-tion at Œ6.1 mb/d, followed by residential (Œ1.4 mb/d) and ‚other industry™ (Œ1.2 mb/d). Oil demand \\nin the aviation sector is set to expand by 2.3 mb/d, while demand in the petrochemical sector by \\n2045 is forecast to be at levels comparable with 2020.\\n112\\nFor the non-OECD region, demand in all sectors is projected to grow, except in electricity genera\\n-tion. The largest demand increase is seen in the road transportation (+12.4 mb/d) and petrochemi\\n-cal (+4.2 mb/d) sectors. Significant growth is also expected in the aviation (+3.5 mb/d), residential \\n(+2.1 mb/d) and ‚other industry™ (+1.8 mb/d) sectors.\\nFigure 3.15\\nSectoral oil demand in the OECD region, 2020 and 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.16\\nSectoral oil demand in non-OECD countries, 2020 and 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.16\\nmboe/d05101520253035mb/d20202045RoadAviationRail/waterwaysMarinebunkersPetro-chemicalsOtherindustryResid./Comm./Agr.Electr.generationFigure 3.15\\nmboe/dgenerationRoadAviationRail/waterwaysMarinebunkersPetro-chemicalsOtherindustryResid./Comm./Agr.Electr.generation0510152025mb/d20202045113\\n3.2.1 Road transportation\\nThe pandemic and subsequent recovery plans introduced new dimensions and opportunities to \\nthe mobility sector. The restrictions in place during lockdown periods exerted downward pres\\n-sure on all transport modes, with road and aviation sub-sectors affected the most. Demand in the \\nroad transport sector contracted most in Europe and North America, especially during the first \\nand second waves of the pandemic. At its peak, road transport activities declined by over 80% in \\nall major OECD economic centres. The contraction during the second wave, which spread to early \\n2021, was invariably lower due to the vaccination rollout, and less restrictive lockdowns. \\nThe underlying effects on road transport development, however, varied from region-to-region, \\nand affected powertrains differently. The growth of ICE vehicles was hindered during the pan\\n-demic and will likely remain subdued during the rebound period. However, growth in the electric \\nmobility segment was resilient and continued to rise unabated. \\nEconomic activity in China was quick to return in 2020, leading to an earlier pickup in new vehicle \\nregistrations in the region, including rising new energy vehicle (NEV) sales. In the early stages of \\nthe pandemic, passenger vehicle sales in the OECD contracted due in part to the shutdown of man\\n-ufacturing facilities. US new vehicle registrations declined by about 15% in 2020, but rebounded \\nin the last quarter of the year and into much of 2021 due to the availability of low-interest financ\\n-ing and some changes in consumer behaviour, including the avoidance of public transport and air \\ntravel. \\nAt the global level, new vehicle registrations plummeted by about 25% in 1H20. Full year new \\nvehicle registrations over the year crawled forward, reaching about 80 million vehicles Œ a clear \\n15Œ16% decline from average sales during the pre-COVID-19 period. New vehicle registrations are \\nexpected to increase over 2021, but the rate of growth will likely remain tapered. \\nAt the same time, many countries embedded accelerated energy system decarbonization in their \\npost-COVID-19 recovery stimulus plans, including emissions reductions in the transport sector. \\nThe new strategic drive includes a reset of target dates for the phase-out of ICEs, especially in \\nEurope, with electrification of the transport sector regarded as a primary way to reduce emissions. \\nThe short-term influence of COVID-19 on the total vehicle fleet will ultimately also impact future \\nprospects. This effect also presents itself unevenly in different transport segments, with the \\ntapering pattern varying from region-to-region. Principally though, the transport sector will con\\n-tinue expanding and will be guided by demographic factors, including economic prosperity, devel\\n-oping trade relations, technology and evolving policies. \\nThese growth drivers now face uncertainties that inadvertently make any projections somewhat \\ncomplicated. Uncertainties in economic prospects, capital investment and technology deployment \\nare among the factors with the potential to shape pathways for vehicle fleet development. In addi\\n-tion, policies and regulatory frameworks are currently playing a greater role in the further evolu\\n-tion of fossil fuel-driven vehicles, especially in developed economies. \\nDespite this, there is still huge potential to continue the future expansion of the vehicle fleet, \\nespecially in developing regions with lower motorization rates and promising economic prospects. \\nDeveloped country stock expansion is projected to progress at a very slow rate due to the attain\\n-ment of saturation and a well-established public transport system.\\nVehicle stock\\nIn principle, vehicle stock growth is closely linked to economic growth, demographics, the motor\\n-ization rate, policy measures and technology deployment. At the regional level, demographic \\nchanges, socio-economic conditions and consumer preferences are among the major drivers for \\n114\\nvehicle demand and ownership. Low car ownership plays a significant role in driving the vehicle \\nfleet in developing nations. Hence, the vehicle fleet is set to continue to increase in non-OECD \\nregions due to this ‚spare™ motorization capacity. However, the growth of ICEs in China and Other \\nAsia regions with congested cities may be partly hindered by regulators that enact policies and \\nmeasures restricting vehicle growth to abate pollution in mega-cities.\\nVehicle demand in other non-OECD regions and emerging economies will continue to be driven \\nby per capita GDP and demographic structures. India, Other Asia, and the Middle East and Africa \\nare set to drive vehicle growth. Unlike OECD regions, where the effects of a decoupling with GDP \\nare visible due to saturation, non-OECD regions will continue to demand more vehicles with \\n increasing disposable middle class incomes. \\nOn the other hand, passenger car fleet development in the OECD, especially in Europe, is already \\nbeing curtailed. Growth-impeding factors include a well-structured public transport system, \\npolicies, shared mobility and an already high motorization rate. Concerns over transport sector \\nemissions and additional policy-related decarbonization thrusts, led by Europe, stagnated pas\\n-senger vehicle stock development, especially for those with an oil-based powertrain. Many large \\nEuropean cities are introducing measures that depress the use of vehicles with lower efficiency \\nstandards to safeguard the environment and abate pollution. Despite this, private vehicles still \\nremain the most popular mode of transport in the OECD.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing recovery period altered the previously established long-\\nterm outlook trajectory for vehicle stock development. This is particularly noticeable in OECD \\nEurope, where additional policy impetus and support for further electrification and efficiency \\nenhancements are dwarfing the stock growth of ICE powertrains. Conversely, consumer pref\\n-erences during the pandemic and rising vaccination rates have in 2021 influenced the demand \\nrebound. This is particularly apparent in waning public transport use in preference to private cars \\namong the middle class, as well as diminishing mobility-as-service habits, especially car pooling \\nand sharing. Other regions outside of the OECD that were more vulnerable to the knock-on effects \\nof the pandemic, such as the Middle East & Africa, have suffered from a slower economic recovery. \\nTherefore, vehicle stock growth has decelerated even further. \\nNew passenger car sales in China declined by only 6% in 2020. This is mainly due to China™s \\nhandling of the crisis and its easing of lockdowns earlier than other countries. In addition, local \\nauthorities assisted in strengthening the rebound by offering new incentives and relaxing sales \\nrestrictions. NEVs especially benefited from policy and regulatory preferences. Additionally, vehi\\n-cle sales in China received more impetus via the introduction of digital innovation, in which cus\\n-tomers have direct access to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) via virtual showrooms. It \\nis important to note that, despite a setback in passenger car sales, NEVs continued to grow, add\\n-ing about 1.4 million vehicles in 2020. Moreover, the expansion of charging infrastructure and the \\nreinforcement of battery-as-a-service (BaaS) continued.\\nIn OECD Americas, new vehicle registrations fell in 2020, dropping below the usual 17 million \\nvehicles p.a. With only about 14 million new vehicles sold, the year recorded an average 15% \\ndecline compared with the pre-crisis period. It marks 2020 as the single year with the highest con\\n-traction since the 2008/2009 recession. Sales destruction was especially prominent in the 1H20, \\nwhen manufacturers were obliged to shut facilities and dealers were forced to close showrooms. \\nHowever, sales quickly picked up in the last quarter of the year and into 2021 with the vaccination \\nrollout and economic activity on the rise. \\nA large majority of US sales were in the ICEs segment. Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) new registra\\n-tions continued to increase, maintaining the trend of previous years, and the sale of these high-\\ncapacity vehicles continues to impact overall efficiency gains, which are improving at a slow pace. \\nEV sales growth in the US suffered a setback due to the pandemic and given the fallout from \\n115\\neroding federal tax credits, among other reasons. EV sales in the US did increase by around 4% in \\n2020, but this was much less than that witnessed in Europe and China. \\nThe European ICE market contracted significantly in 2020. The pandemic impacted European new \\npassenger car registrations, causing a decline of about 24% compared with 2019. This resulted \\nin sales of only 10 million passenger cars due to containment measures that were implemented \\nacross the entire region. Four of the five largest passenger vehicle markets (France, Italy, the \\nUK and Spain) recorded declines of more than 20%. Germany™s new passenger car registra\\n-tions plummeted by 19.1%. With only 2.9 million passenger cars sold in the country, it is the low\\n-est recorded level since 2013. Equally affected were European new registrations of commercial \\n vehicles, which dropped 19%. \\nNevertheless, EV stocks increased in Europe due to improved sales in 2020. In fact, new EV sales \\ngrowth in Europe surpassed that of China for the first time. New registration of European EVs \\nsurged by about 136%, adding approximately 1.3 million units to the inventory and making it the \\nnew EV-growth centre. With the pandemic-induced decline of ICE sales in Europe, the share of EVs \\nin total new vehicle registrations reached 10.5% in 2020. \\nThe EU™s ‚green™ recovery plans and stimulus, specifically, the NGEU and European Green Deal, all \\nincluded enhanced ambitions and strategies for ‚greening™ the transport sector. Major car man\\n-ufacturers and high-end technology groups are increasing investment in electric mobility. Other \\ndrivers for EV growth include additional investment in charging infrastructure, closing price parity \\nwith ICEs through subsidies in several countries and further developments in battery technology \\nto address range anxiety. \\nTurning to the Outlook, the global passenger car stock is projected to have surpassed two bil\\n-lion vehicles by 2045, as depicted in Table 3.4. Most of this growth will come from the developing \\nregions. China and India alone are forecast to be responsible for the largest growth percentage, as \\nthese countries will have the highest urbanization rates, with teeming populations and significant \\nGrowth\\n2020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n282.2\\n286.4\\n300.5\\n314.4\\n324.4\\n331.8\\n49.6\\nOECD Europe\\n258.5\\n260.3\\n261.5\\n263.6\\n264.7\\n264.8\\n6.3\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n93.4\\n94.6\\n94.5\\n94.1\\n93.3\\n92.3\\nŒ1.2\\nOECD\\n634.1\\n641.3\\n656.5\\n672.0\\n682.4\\n688.8\\n54.7\\nLatin America\\n83.0\\n88.7\\n95.6\\n102.1\\n108.4\\n115.4\\n32.5\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n38.2\\n47.4\\n61.0\\n78.1\\n99.6\\n122.9\\n84.7\\nIndia\\n30.9\\n48.9\\n73.5\\n105.2\\n142.3\\n178.6\\n147.7\\nChina\\n184.5\\n255.0\\n323.2\\n382.7\\n426.8\\n463.9\\n279.4\\nOther Asia\\n76.8\\n104.0\\n140.4\\n181.8\\n225.6\\n268.3\\n191.6\\nOPEC\\n54.2\\n68.7\\n84.4\\n100.6\\n116.8\\n133.1\\n79.0\\nRussia\\n36.1\\n41.3\\n43.2\\n44.6\\n45.4\\n46.3\\n10.2\\nOther Eurasia\\n48.2\\n52.5\\n57.2\\n61.3\\n64.7\\n68.4\\n20.2\\nNon-OECD\\n551.8\\n706.5\\n878.5\\n1,056.4\\n1,229.8\\n1,397.0\\n845.2\\nWorld\\n1,185.9 \\n1,347.8 \\n1,535.0 \\n1,728.4 \\n1,912.2 \\n2,085.9 \\n899.9 \\nTable 3.4\\nNumber of passenger cars, 2020Œ2045\\nmillions\\nSource: OPEC.\\n116\\nGDP expansion.

Developing trade, urbanization and promising GDP growth play a significant role in \\nexpanding commercial vehicles. China, India and the Middle East & Africa are adding commer\\n-cial vehicle fleets at a much faster rate than in the OECD region. This trend is particularly valid for \\n minivan-delivery vehicles and freight trucks. \\nIt is expected that non-OECD commercial vehicles will have increased by about 208 million units \\nat the end of the forecast period. Most non-OECD growth will be driven by China and India. Large \\nincremental stock is also projected for Other Asia and Africa, as infrastructure expansion encour\\n-ages inter-regional trade and the exchange of goods and services. It is worth noting that new addi\\n-tions to the non-OECD region outnumber the OECD region more than four-fold. Overall, the global \\nstock of commercial vehicles is expected to expand in the long-term by about 255 million by 2045.\\nVehicle fleet composition\\nCOVID-19 avails the opportunity for electric powertrain expansion, especially in Europe and China. \\nStrengthening emissions regulations and additional policy thrusts supporting the clean energy \\ntransition are behind the rapid growth of electric mobility.

The NGEU recovery stim\\n-ulus and European Green Deal provide platforms and the required impetus for the uptake of EVs in \\nEurope. Equally, in China, regulators revised the dual-credit policy for a stepwise increase in NEV \\ncredit ratios to reach 18% by 2023 and offered an additional extension to the subsidy. The policy \\nalso introduces a further reduction in corporate average fuel consumption for ICEs. Hence, the \\nyear 2020 witnessed increasing shares of EVs in Europe and China. \\nIn 2020, about three million electric propelled vehicles (plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) \\nand battery electric vehicles (BEV)) were added to global EV stocks Œ Europe and China alone \\naccounted for more than 85% of the new sales figures. With the sale of about 1.3 million EVs in \\n2020, Europe is nearly on par with China regarding sales growth. The US saw a marginal increase \\ncompared to 2019. Other OECD regions, including Japan, recorded declines in 2020. \\nDespite impressive growth in EVs, full year 2020 new vehicle registrations in Europe still consisted \\nof over 75% of gasoline and diesel engine vehicles. Market forces continue to drive the growth of \\nICEs in developing regions. Hybrid vehicles are following a similar growth pattern to regular ICEs. \\nWhile the expansion in NGVs is dwarfing the other vehicle types in the passenger car segment, it \\nis also receiving attention in long-range freight trucks in China and India.\\nTurning to the projections, Figure 3.17 presents the expected long-term evolving structural com\\n-position of both passenger and commercial vehicle fleets. This figure takes into consideration \\nthe implications of current and assumed future vehicle sales based on the powertrain shift and \\ndeployment. It is noticeable that the structural change in fleet composition is proceeding rather \\ngradually due to a large base of conventional vehicles in the global fleet. Hence, the transition to \\nalternative powertrains will take decades to accomplish, even if new vehicle registrations in this \\narea advance at a higher rate. \\nFigure 3.17 indicates that EVs are set to become the fastest-growing alternative powertrain. This \\ntrend will continue to gradually change the fleet composition in the long-term. The electric power\\n-train is set to overtake NGVs in terms of nominal volumes within the global fleet structure during \\n118\\nthe current decade. Electrification of the global fleet is set to grow steeply in both the medium- \\nand long-term, attaining a share of about 10% in around 2035 and rising further to almost 20% \\nby 2045. It is estimated that by 2045, the on-the-road EV fleet will approach 500 million vehicles.\\nIt is worth noting that powertrain electrification in all regions is only strongly impacting the \\npassenger car segment. Electrification of other segments is expected to remain at lower lev\\n-els. Further, apart from Japan, Europe and the US, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are receiving less \\nattention due to cost and technology readiness. Fuel cell vehicles remain a niche market in other \\nregions. It should be noted, however, that China has revised its NEV policy and supports fuel \\ncell vehicle research and the demonstration stage through the allocation of funds for that pur\\n-pose. The new hydrogen infrastructure development framework in China is also starting strategic \\nresearch & development (R&D) on hydrogen energy to chart a specific industrial plan. \\nFrom the perspective of Asia, India™s transport sector electrification is progressing rather slowly \\nin the passenger car segment. However, the current determination and announcements from the \\ngovernment indicate an intent to adopt an EV penetration roadmap. It is worth mentioning that \\ntwo- and three-wheeler electrification is progressing at a faster rate than four-wheelers in India. \\nRegarding anticipated EV growth in China, it is projected that over 40% of new passenger car reg\\n-istrations will be electric by 2045. This percentage will be even larger for municipal commuter \\nbuses and commercial delivery vans. \\nHowever, electric mobility in other regions of the world outside of those highlighted is set to pro\\n-gress rather slowly.\\nSome growth is also projected for NGVs, with a global increase in the range of 80 million between \\n2020 and 2045. Although LNG and CNG are gaining relevance in the commercial vehicle segment, \\ntheir share in the global fleet is expected to remain below 5%. Natural gas in the form of LNG is pen\\n-etrating heavy-duty commercial vehicles in India and China. Greater NGV penetration is anticipated \\nin mainland China, due to additional investment in LNG infrastructure. \\nAs a result of these trends, ICEs will continue to leverage a larger base to maintain a leading role \\nin the composition of the global fleet. The outlook sees ICEs constituting about 76% of the world \\nvehicle fleet by 2045, largely sustained by fleet size increases in developing regions. Transport \\nelectrification is in its infancy stage in most developing regions and it will take some time until a \\nsignificant penetration of EVs is achieved. In absolute numbers, projections suggest that there will \\nbe close to 2 billion ICEs on the road by 2045.\\nBox 3.1\\nCharging EVs: is it really that cheap?\\nOver the past year, the world has witnessed a strong increase in EV sales, particularly in Europe. \\nEVs are indeed much more visible on the streets of many cities, including Vienna, where the OPEC \\nSecretariat is located. In addition, the number of public charging stations has increased signifi\\n-cantly since 2016. There were around 91,000 charging stations in Europe in 2016. This figure \\nincreased to 360,000 stations in 2020, and there is strong policy support for further developments. \\nAnalysis related to EVs has been focused on evolving battery costs and the related purchas\\n-ing costs of EVs in recent years. This is, for good reason, relevant when comparing EVs to \\n119\\nICE vehicles and estimating the possible pathways of future EV deployment. However, the \\nissue of running costs Œ such as charging costs Œ has been much less discussed, although \\nit is a significant part of overall EV costs and an important aspect when comparing EV run\\n-ning costs to those of an ICE.\\nThere is a general assumption that although EVs are still relatively expensive to purchase, \\ncharging is relatively cheap for final consumers and cost competitive relative to gasoline or \\ndiesel. However, costs for EV charging are not uniform and depend on various factors. \\nFirst, there are strong regional differences in electricity costs, related network fees and \\ntaxes. In the EU, the lowest household electricity price during the second half of 2020 was \\nrecorded in Bulgaria and Hungary at around 0.1 EUR/kilowatt hour (kWh) and the highest in \\nGermany at around 0.3 EUR/kWh. This does not only include the price, but also network fees \\n(for transmission and distribution services) and various taxes (including support for renew\\n-able power). \\nIn fact, the energy component of household electricity prices represents only a small portion \\nof the overall final price. In recent years, the share of taxes (including subsidy support for \\nrenewables) and network fees has increased significantly in some countries. In Germany, for \\ninstance, the share of the energy price in the average electricity bill was only around 24% in \\nearly 2021 (Figure 1). The share of network fees was calculated at 24.5%, while taxes (VAT, \\nelectricity tax, support scheme for renewables, etc.) accounted for more than 50% of house\\n-hold electricity bills. Of course, these shares vary in different countries, but given EU targets \\nto increase the portion of renewables in the power generation mix, the share of taxes and \\nnetwork fees could increase significantly in other European countries too.\\nFigure 1\\nGerman electricity price for households and final electricity demand \\nBox 3.1 Figure 1\\nmboe/dTWh• cent/kWhEnergy cost and distributionNetwork feesRenewables supportOther fees and taxesGross electricity demand (RHS)200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017201820192020202152054056058060062064005101520253035Source: BDEW, AG Energiebilanzen, Sueddeutsche Zeitung.\\nFurthermore, the cost of EV charging also depends on various charging modes. Charging \\nat home (or possibly at work) is normally more cost-competitive relative to charging at a \\npublic charging station. In addition, charging at home offers permanent access to a charg\\n-ing device. However, while charging through a standard outlet (up to 3.5 kW) is cheaper, the \\nconsequence is a longer charging time. \\n120\\nThis is why most local utilities recommend installing a so-called mid-accelerated charger \\n(Wallbox) with capacity above 7 kW and below 22 kW. While a Wallbox device and its installa\\n-tion may result in additional costs, many national and local governments currently offer sub\\n-sidies. Due to higher network usage, Wallbox installations may also create additional net\\n-work fees and will depend on regional network policies and costs. Another option is to install \\nsolar panels, and thus source less electricity from the network. This would help reduce net\\n-work fees and taxes for the owner™s personal consumption, including EV charging, but this \\noption is only available to homeowners. \\nOn the other hand, costs for public charging vary, depending on the capacity of the \\ncharging spot, charging time (peak or off-peak), possible subscriptions, etc. Some pro\\n-viders offer simple charging at an energy price (per kWh), while others have introduced \\na standing fee (fee for the time spent at the charging point). Discounts are offered to \\ncustomers who pay a monthly or annual subscription fee, but not to non-subscribing \\ncustomers. The capacity of charging points can vary from 3.5 kW to over 50 kW, with \\nsome providers offering charging at an even higher capacity (primarily motorway charg\\n-ing). A general rule is that the higher the capacity of the charging station the higher the \\ncost. Increasingly, charging providers are also introducing penalty fees if the maximum \\nstanding time is exceeded. \\nConsidering average consumption of around 20 kWh per 100 kilometres (km) for mid-size \\nEVs (as per ADAC [General German Automobile Club] tests), costs when charging at home \\ncurrently start at around •4.2Œ4.5 in countries like Austria, Italy, France or Spain (with an \\naverage household electricity price of around •0.20Œ0.22/kWh in the 2H20). In Germany, \\nhowever, costs would be significantly greater due to a higher average household electricity \\nprice of around •0.3/kWh, reaching •6 per 100 km. However, some providers have started \\noffering metering services at home, which would enable consumers to profit from lower off-\\npeak, such as night or weekend, prices. As already mentioned, there are additional costs due \\nto potential investment in a Wallbox and related network fees. \\nCharging at public stations varies greatly depending on the service provider, the capacity of \\nthe charging device and the time of charging. In some countries, off-peak charging is offered \\nat levels around •0.07/kWh. This would mean that a 100 km load would cost only around \\n•1.5. However, daily tariffs are usually higher, reaching •5Œ7.5 for mid-accelerated charg\\n-ing (up to 22 kW) . For faster charging, the cost goes up significantly, reaching levels around \\n•6.5 or even up to •12 per 100 km. Thus, the total charging cost for EVs very much depends \\non how a vehicle is used and where it is charged (city driving or motorway, private or public \\ncharging point). \\nIt begs the question: how do EV charging costs compare with the fuel costs of an ICE? \\nFirst, ICE costs are much more uniform, with marginal differences between EU coun\\n-tries. The newest ICE models, equivalent to mid-size EVs, consume around six litres of \\ngasoline or five litres of diesel per 100 km, as confirmed by German ADAC. At current EU \\nprices (as of mid-July 2021), this leads to a total cost of around •9 for gasoline and •6.5 \\nfor diesel per 100 km. Consequently, costs for specific EV charging modes, such as mid-\\naccelerated public charging, come close to or are higher than the cost of diesel. Costs \\nfor super-fast charging on motorways come close to or are even higher than equivalent \\ngasoline costs. \\nDue to the wide range of costs for EV charging, it is obvious that EV drivers with access to \\ntheir own Wallbox, mostly owners of single-family dwellings, possibly in combination with \\npersonal PV modules, or charging facilities at work, have a clear cost advantage. Other \\n121\\ndrivers are disadvantaged in having to charge their EVs at public charging points, mostly at \\nhigher prices.\\nLooking forward, it remains to be seen how charging costs for EVs in the EU will develop \\ngoing forward. Electricity prices in the EU could increase in the future given the clear ten\\n-dency for electrification and potentially rising electricity demand. In mid-July 2021, the \\nGerman Minister of Economy stated that Germany™s gross electricity demand could increase \\nby up to 665 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2030, which is almost a 20% increase relative to 2020 \\nlevels. This is a strong increase, given that electricity demand in most EU member states \\n(including Germany, as shown in Figure 1) has been stable or declining since 2010. \\nAt the same time, electricity prices for households increased significantly between 2010 \\nand 2020, for example, Germany +28%, France +48%, Greece +42%, Belgium +43% and \\nSpain +30%. There are many reasons for this, such as rising fuel costs and CO\\n2 prices, \\nincreasing network fees for transmission and distribution, and support schemes for \\nrenewables. As European countries are likely to expand their renewable capacities, costs \\nfor renewable support and network fees related to renewable expansion are expected to \\nincrease, thus raising household and EV tariffs even more in the years to come. In addition, \\ndeclining state tax income related to the consumption of oil products, such as diesel and \\ngasoline, and ownership of ICEs is likely to decline, given the expected increased share of \\nEVs in future car sales. This could lead to the introduction of taxes on EVs and their elec\\n-tricity consumption. \\nAt the same time, while it is impossible to predict the price of diesel or gasoline in the years \\nto come, it is certain that the efficiency of ICEs will improve, reducing fuel consumption. \\nImprovements in engine design, as well as rising hybridization of ICEs, could lead to an effi\\n-ciency improvement of almost 20% by 2030, relative to current levels. \\nHowever, though these trends will be important, the further development of EU energy \\npolicies in the road transportation sector Œ including regulation of the EV sector and pos\\n-sibly stricter regulations related to gasoline and diesel Œ will be decisive in defining the \\n competitive position of EVs relative to ICE vehicles in the coming decades. \\nOutlook for oil demand in road transportation\\nVehicle fleet growth and composition changes will continue to influence global oil demand. The \\nCOVID-19 pandemic had a devastating effect on the road transport sector, with sales plummeting \\nto the lowest level in decades. New waves of infection are also causing some governments to reim\\n-pose lockdown measures that further constrain mobility. The influence of teleworking on mobil\\n-ity is now a given, and offers striking opportunities for transportation cost savings. Teleworking, \\nin addition to already declining pre-crisis vehicle miles travelled (VMT), especially in developed \\nregions, will support the curtailing of oil demand in the road transport sector. On the flip side, the \\npandemic is also causing an increasing number of customers to avoid public transport in prefer\\n-ence of personal mobility solutions. This ‚mode-switching™ process has the potential to increase \\noil use in transportation. \\nFurthermore, challenges arising from the energy transition and efficiency improvements in ICEs \\nare expected to continue exerting pressure on future oil demand, as well as the rapid penetra\\n-tion of EVs. These, and other drivers, are impacting future regional oil demand growth in the road \\ntransport sector, as presented in Table 3.6.\\n122\\nThis table portrays obvious differences in road transport sector oil demand between OECD and \\nnon-OECD regions. While growth in non-OECD regions is mainly supported by a rising vehicle fleet \\nand increasing economic activity, OECD growth is curtailed by the penetration of alternative fuel \\nvehicles (AFVs) and improved efficiencies. Even though pandemic multiplier effects and recovery \\nplans continue to pose uncertainties to future growth, this year™s Outlook projects that transport \\nsector demand in the non-OECD region will add up to about 12.4 mb/d and expand on average by \\naround 2% p.a. between 2020 and 2045. \\nSustained growth in the region will mainly come from India, which is forecast to contribute almost \\n4 mb/d to global growth. Equally, population growth and economic activity in Africa and the Middle \\nEast and in Other Asia will bolster non-OECD demand in the long-term. Strong policy footing for \\nEV expansion and fuel-switching, especially in the long-haul trucking sector, is anticipated to \\nstagnate China™s long-term oil use in this sector. \\nOil demand in the OECD region is projected to decline to 14.3 mb/d by 2045. This is more than \\n 6 mb/d lower than in 2020. In fact, the level of oil decline in the OECD is even greater, since \\npart of it is masked by the demand recovery in the initial years of the forecast period. As pre\\n-sented in Figure 3.18, the decline in OECD demand is mainly attributed to the penetration of AFVs \\n (Œ4.2 mb/d) and improving efficiencies (Œ4.1 mb/d). Some contributions to the drop will also come from \\ndeclining VMT due to teleworking and other factors. The impact of VMT is, however, much smaller, \\n estimated at a drop of 1.7 mb/d.\\nIn non-OECD regions, low motorization rates continue to further support car ownership and stock \\ndevelopment. At the beginning of the outlook period, the pandemic and its multiplier effects \\nslowed vehicle sales. However, as economic activity rebounded and given increasing urbanization, \\nthe vehicle fleet began to surge again. Moreover, most fleets in the region are less efficient and the \\nreplacement rate is lower, translating into less efficiency gains. This leads to oil demand growth \\nGrowth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n14.1\\n12.3\\n13.9\\n12.6\\n11.3\\n10.2\\n9.5\\nŒ2.8\\nOECD Europe\\n6.7\\n5.8\\n6.2\\n5.6\\n4.9\\n4.3\\n3.7\\nŒ2.2\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n2.7\\n2.3\\n2.5\\n2.2\\n1.8\\n1.5\\n1.1\\nŒ1.2\\nOECD\\n23.5\\n20.5\\n22.6\\n20.3\\n18.1\\n16.1\\n14.3\\nŒ6.1\\nLatin America\\n3.0\\n2.8\\n3.1\\n3.2\\n3.3\\n3.4\\n3.5\\n0.7\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n1.91.7\\n2.2\\n2.5\\n2.8\\n3.2\\n3.6\\n1.9India\\n1.91.8\\n2.5\\n3.3\\n4.0\\n4.8\\n5.6\\n3.8\\nChina\\n5.6\\n5.4\\n6.5\\n6.9\\n7.17.17.11.7\\nOther Asia\\n3.4\\n3.0\\n3.8\\n4.2\\n4.6\\n5.0\\n5.3\\n2.3\\nOPEC\\n3.1\\n2.9\\n3.4\\n3.8\\n4.1\\n4.4\\n4.5\\n1.7\\nRussia\\n1.2\\n1.1\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n1.2\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n0.0\\nOther Eurasia\\n0.9\\n0.8\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n0.3\\nNonŒOECD\\n21.1\\n19.5\\n23.7\\n26.2\\n28.3\\n30.2\\n31.9\\n12.4\\nWorld\\n44.6\\n40.0\\n46.3\\n46.5\\n46.4\\n46.2\\n46.2\\n6.3\\nTable 3.6\\nOil demand in the road transportation sector by region, 2019Œ2045\\nmb/d\\nTotals may not add up due to rounding.\\nSource: OPEC.\\n123\\nFigure 3.18\\nDemand in road transportation in OECD countries, 2020 and 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.18\\nmboe/d20.514.33.10.9Œ4.1Œ4.2Œ1.70510152025Demand in 2020DemandrecoveryIncreasing car fleetFuelefficiencyPenetration of AFVDecliningVMTDemand in 2045mb/dFigure 3.19\\nDemand in road transportation in the non-OECD region, 2020 and 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.19\\nmboe/dElectricitygeneration19.531.91.528.7Œ8.6Œ5.6Œ3.701020304050mb/dDemand in 2020DemandrecoveryIncreasing car fleetFuelefficiencyPenetration of AFVDecliningVMTDemand in 2045that more than offsets the decline from the OECD region.

However, part of this potential demand will be offset by the penetration of AFVs \\n(Œ5.6 mb/d), efficiency gains (Œ8.6 mb/d) and declining VMT (Œ3.7 mb/d).\\n124\\n3.2.2 Aviation\\nAfter many years of impressive growth in the aviation sector, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pan\\n-demic had a devastating effect on the industry. The worst period was the 2Q20, when large num\\n-bers of aircraft were grounded for many weeks/months and oil demand collapsed to its lowest \\nlevel. The sector™s recovery has taken place more slowly than expected, as new waves of the pan\\n-demic caused a re-emergence of regional travel restrictions and a number of additional obstacles \\narose, especially for international and long-haul flights.\\nThese developments will have significant implications on oil demand in global aviation in both \\nthe medium- and long-term. Demand projections included in this outlook assume only a gradual \\ndemand recovery to pre-pandemic levels, reflecting the expectation of a relatively slow increase \\nin aviation traffic, especially in business travel.\\nThe projections are also clouded by many uncertainties. The appearance of new COVID-19 variants \\nmakes any projection challenging. With the exception of a few countries, vaccinations are progress\\n-ing slower than expected only a few months ago, especially in developing countries. Moreover, it is \\nstill unclear how, and for how long, consumer behaviour will be impacted by the pandemic.\\nBearing in mind these uncertainties, oil demand in the aviation sector is projected to continue \\nrecovering in the coming years to reach pre-pandemic levels of 6.7 mb/d sometime in 2024, as \\npresented in Figure 3.20. This level is expected to further increase to 7.2 mb/d by the end of the \\nmedium-term. From a regional perspective, the recovery process will be somewhat faster in non-\\nOECD countries, which are expected to already reach pre-pandemic levels in 2023. In contrast, \\ndemand in the OECD regions is forecast to remain below 2019 levels during the entire medium-\\nterm period, as it was more severely affected in 2020.\\n Long-term demand in the sector will face further challenges. On the positive side, robust GDP \\ngrowth in developing countries, a growing population and expanding middle class, an expected \\nincrease in the frequency of air travel per citizen, and increasing cargo movements between \\nregions, will work towards supporting a rising number of flights and related oil demand. A coun\\n-terbalancing effect to this potential growth will come in the form of a quest for improved efficiency \\nFigure 3.20\\nOil demand in the aviation sector, 2019Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.20\\n01234567820192020202120222023202420252026OECDChinaOther AsiaOther non-OECDmb/dmb/d125\\nand emissions reductions. The two leading targets for the aviation sector Œ set by the International \\nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and IATA Œ are a cap on net aviation CO\\n2 emissions (carbon-\\nneutral growth) on a 2019 basis and a reduction in net aviation CO\\n2 emissions of 50% by 2050 \\n (compared with 2005 levels). \\nBroadly, this should be achieved by a combination of measures, such as more efficient technol\\n-ogy, optimization of scheduling, air traffic control, route optimization and emissions-offsetting \\nprogrammes in other sectors. It is worth noting that the original agreement for capping emis\\n-sions in the aviation sector assumed 2020 as a basis for the pilot phase, which will run from 2021Œ\\n2023. However, a COVID-19-induced drop in emissions would, according to the ICAO, ﬁcreate an \\n inappropriate economic burden on aeroplane operatorsﬂ.\\nThe main options to achieving better efficiency in the sector include improving the aerodynamic \\nproperties of wings, the extended use of carbon fibre-reinforced compounds and new lightweight, \\nbut resistant metal alloys that substantially reduce aircraft weight. These advances should be \\nsupplemented by higher load factors, better navigational equipment and, more importantly, \\n improving fuel economy in future aircraft. \\nBesides improved efficiencies, fuel substitution could also potentially reduce future oil demand in \\nthe aviation sector. It is expected that small electric aircraft with up to 10 seats could start enter\\n-ing the market in the current decade and evolutionally increase in size up to 150 seats thereafter. \\nHowever, according to current projections, it is unlikely that a fully electric short-range aircraft of \\nthis size will substitute a significant part of oil demand during the forecast period of this Outlook.\\nTaking into account the most likely impact of these factors, Table 3.7 summarizes projected \\nregional oil demand in the aviation sector over the forecast period. At the global level, oil demand \\nin this sector is expected to expand by 5.8 mb/d during the forecast period from 3.5 mb/d in 2020 to \\n9.3 mb/d in 2045. Similar to other sectors, the larger part of this incremental demand is projected \\nfor non-OECD countries (+3.5 mb/d), while total OECD is set to grow by 2.3 mb/d.\\nTable 3.7\\nOil demand in the aviation sector by region, 2019Œ2045\\nGrowth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n1.90.9\\n1.91.92.0\\n2.0\\n2.1\\n1.2\\nOECD Europe\\n1.4\\n0.8\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n1.4\\n1.4\\n1.4\\n0.6OECD Asia Oceania\\n0.5\\n0.2\\n0.5\\n0.60.60.60.7\\n0.5\\nOECD\\n3.8\\n1.9\\n3.7\\n3.8\\n4.0\\n4.1\\n4.2\\n2.3\\nLatin America\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.3\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.4\\nIndia\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.60.5\\nChina\\n0.7\\n0.3\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n0.9\\nOther Asia\\n0.8\\n0.5\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n1.2\\n1.3\\n0.8\\nOPEC\\n0.4\\n0.2\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.60.7\\n0.7\\n0.5\\nRussia\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.1\\nOther Eurasia\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nNon-OECD\\n2.9\\n1.6\\n3.4\\n3.8\\n4.3\\n4.8\\n5.1\\n3.5\\nWorld\\n6.7\\n3.5\\n7.1\\n7.6\\n8.3\\n8.8\\n9.3\\n5.8\\nmb/d\\nSource: OPEC.\\n126\\nHowever, these figures change significantly compared with pre-pandemic levels in 2019. In \\nthis case, demand growth in the OECD would be in the range of only 0.3 mb/d as, after recov\\n-ering from the current crisis, it will represent a mature market where growth is constrained \\nby infrastructure capacity and only a minor population increase. In the non-OECD, the adjust\\n-ment would be much less pronounced. Growth in this region would be at 2.3 mb/d, amplifying \\nits importance.\\n3.2.3 Marine bunkers\\nAs with all other sectors, maritime trade was also significantly affected by the COVID-19 pan\\n-demic. Broadly mirroring the decline in global GDP, according to UNCTAD , the volume of interna\\n-tional maritime trade declined by 4.1% in 2020. This, however, has already shifted the other way in \\n2021, with trade expected to recover by 4.8% on the back of a strong recovery in economic activity. \\nBesides the immediate impact of shifting trade volumes, the pandemic also raises a number of \\nissues that could potentially have implications on sector developments. It primarily highlights \\nthe importance of trade in the production chain of various products, potentially leading to a shift \\nin risk-management processes. Another consideration relates to changing consumer behav\\n-iour and spending habits. Finally, the elevated place of climate change issues on policymakers™ \\nagendas will undoubtedly affect not only the volume of future trade, but also the way goods are \\ntransported. \\nOne of the key assumptions adopted in this Outlook is that global GDP will continue growing in the \\nyears to come, although at a slower pace compared with 2021. This will result in growing ship\\n-ping activity and oil demand in the sector, at least over the current decade, as the turnover time \\nin the shipping industry is long. However, long-term oil demand prospects for marine bunkers is \\nless certain given the possibilities of substitution options, improved efficiencies and a potentially \\n weakening link between economic growth and maritime trade.\\nIn this regard, the IMO targets for efficiency improvements in the industry are of particular \\nimportance. The next IMO target is to achieve 30% efficiency improvements by 2025 for all \\nnew ships compared with those built in 2014. The main tools to enforce the regulation are the \\nEnergy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI), mandatory for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency \\nManagement Plan, mandatory for all ships. In the long-term, the IMO aims to achieve a 50% \\nreduction in overall GHG emissions from marine transport by 2050, compared with 2008 lev\\n-els. This is a challenging target, which, if achieved, would have significant implications for \\nfuture oil demand in the sector. \\nIt is clear that technology will contribute to efficiency improvements for ICEs used in maritime \\ntransport, though current engines are already quite efficient. One method to improve fuel effi\\n-ciency is the use of waste heat recovery units, which are widely available on the market. Some \\nimprovements could be achieved through reduced internal friction, eliminating losses caused \\nby scavenging and other fluid flows, as well as improved combustion processes. Another option \\noffers slow steaming. However, a slower ship also needs more time to get to its destination, \\nand fuel and cost savings are lower when referring to specific fuel consumption per tonne-mile.\\nHowever, the aforementioned measures will not be sufficient to achieve required emissions \\n reductions. As a result, oil substitution by other energy sources will be needed and the shipping \\nindustry is currently at a technology crossroads in its search for alternative powertrains.\\nThe most likely alternative is LNG. The availability of LNG bunkering facilities has increased sig\\n-nificantly in recent years and LNG engines constitute more than 10% of the share of order books \\nfor new-build vessels. Other alternatives include the use of hydrogen, ammonia and electricity as \\nenergy sources for maritime transport. Prototype vessels for each of these alternative powertrains \\n127\\nalready exist, demonstrating their advantages, but also their disadvantages. However, it is unlikely \\nthat a significant penetration of these engines would be reached before 2045.\\nTable 3.8 translates the impact of these factors on future marine bunker demand to 2045. The \\noverall change between 2020 and 2045 is limited to only 0.7 mb/d, with demand increasing mostly \\nin the period to 2030. This growth is partly related to offsetting the 2020 demand decline, with the \\nrest driven by expanding international trade on the back of robust economic growth in develop\\n-ing countries. Demand for marine bunkers is projected to remain virtually flat after 2030. During \\nthis period, LNG vessels are expected to achieve sufficient penetration, and combined with higher \\n efficiency of oil-based vessels will counterbalance the still-growing trade.\\nGrowth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.4\\n0.4\\nŒ0.1\\nOECD Europe\\n0.8\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.7\\n0.7\\n0.60.6Œ0.1\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\nŒ0.1\\nOECD\\n1.6\\n1.5\\n1.5\\n1.5\\n1.4\\n1.2\\n1.1\\nŒ0.4\\nLatin America\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.1\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.1\\nIndia\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nChina\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.1\\nOther Asia\\n1.2\\n1.0\\n1.2\\n1.3\\n1.4\\n1.5\\n1.6\\n0.5\\nOPEC\\n0.5\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.60.60.60.60.2\\nRussia\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nOther Eurasia\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nNon-OECD\\n2.6\\n2.4\\n2.8\\n3.1\\n3.2\\n3.4\\n3.5\\n1.1\\nWorld\\n4.2\\n3.9\\n4.3\\n4.5\\n4.6\\n4.6\\n4.6\\n0.7\\nTable 3.8\\nOil demand in the marine bunkers sector by region, 2019Œ2045\\nmb/d\\nSource: OPEC.\\nThe largest incremental demand is projected for Other Asia, followed by OPEC and Latin America. \\nHowever, incremental demand in Other Asia is more than three times higher than in other regions. \\nThis is mainly due to a large demand base in the region, which is home to the largest bunkering port in \\nthe world. In contrast, and despite their long coastlines, combined demand for marine bunker fuels in \\nthe Middle East & Africa (excluding OPEC countries), India, Russia and Other Eurasia was just 0.4 mb/d \\nin 2020. Therefore, the growth potential for these regions is rather low in volume terms, though India, \\nfollowed by the Middle East & Africa, is projected to see the fastest growth in relative terms.\\nDemand for marine bunker in the OECD shows a different pattern. It is projected to remain rela\\n-tively stable at around 1.5 mb/d during the current decade. However, a marginal demand decline \\nis projected in the second part of the forecast period, as growth in international trade increasingly \\nshifts to non-OECD regions.\\n3.2.4 Petrochemicals\\nLike many other industries, this sector was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic due to its close \\nlink to economic growth and the uncertainties that surround the recovery also affect prospects for \\nthe industry. \\n128\\nThe impact of the pandemic did, however, work in two ways for the industry. A decline in economic \\nactivity, such as in construction and car manufacturing, lowered demand for petrochemical prod\\n-ucts and various restrictions made the flow of petrochemicals challenging. On the flip side, house\\n-holds increased online shopping and takeaways, inducing a rise in plastic demand for packaging \\nmaterials, including single-use plastics. Demand for this type of plastic also strongly increased \\nin the health care sector. To some extent, the petrochemical industry proved indispensable as a \\nprovider of basic means and daily life products Œ especially in healthcare Œ during the pandemic. \\nThis, however, does not overshadow the fact that plastic pollution remains a major concern for \\nthe world community. \\nAnother important issue for the sector is that projected growth rates going forward may not \\nbe as healthy as the industry requires in order to incentivize sound and sustained investment. \\nEnvironmental considerations and regulations, such as regulations on single-use plastics and \\nrecycling, in general, will play an increasingly important role in shaping long-term prospects by \\nadding another layer of uncertainty and disruption to future petrochemical demand growth.\\nThese issues and concerns are fully reflected in oil demand projections in the petrochemical \\n sector, as presented in Table 3.9. Demand in this sector is set to grow by 4.3 m/d from 13 mb/d \\nin 2020 to 17.3 mb/d in 2045. Essentially all of this growth will come from non-OECD countries, \\nwhere growth potential remains strong. OPEC countries will lead long-term growth with almost \\n1.6 mb/d of additional demand, followed by three Asian regions, each contributing in the range of \\n0.7 mb/d to 0.9 mb/d.\\nIn fact, these four regions are expected to account for more than 90% of oil demand growth in the \\npetrochemical sector by 2045, cumulatively adding 3.9 mb/d to future growth. The concentration \\nof petrochemical facilities in these regions is driven by two major factors Œ feedstock availabil\\n-ity and its competitiveness, and demand for petrochemical products. China™s cracking capacity is \\nmostly naphtha-based.

Non-conventional technologies Œ coal-to-olefins (CTO) and methanol-to-olefins \\n(MTO) Œ are expected to increase in the medium-term, despite rising environmental concerns. \\nNaphtha and other liquid feedstock still lead the expansion in China and Other Asia.\\nAmong other regions, only OECD Americas (mainly the US) will be a source of a meaning\\n-ful increase at 0.4 mb/d. It is to be noted, however, that petrochemical demand in this region is \\nprojected to increase by 1 mb/d between 2020 and 2030. Nevertheless, demand will start fall\\n-ing sometime after 2030 on the back of declining tight oil production and slowing GDP growth. \\nBearing in mind the current uncertainties, it is likely that almost all additional sectoral demand \\nin this region will be sourced from cheap ethane. However, naphtha cracking could be back on a \\ncompetitive trajectory in the US, despite the large dominance of ethane crackers. \\nThe outlook for the petrochemical sector is less optimistic for OECD Europe, where oil demand \\nfor petrochemicals is anticipated to decline, despite expected NGLs trade from the US. Other \\nregions, essentially the Middle East, China and India, will determine European petrochemical \\nchoices in the future as maturing demand and domestic constraints may trigger sectoral ration\\n-alization. OECD Asia Oceania is, to some extent, in the same position as Europe, with the excep\\n-tion of South Korea, where some growth is foreseen to reflect the implementation of several \\nrecent projects. \\nMinor demand growth increments, in the range of 0.1 mb/d, are expected in other regions like \\nRussia, Latin America and the Middle East & Africa, albeit with no significant impact on the sec\\n-tor™s overall demand. Russia has an ambitious plan for the petrochemical sector, but it is unlikely \\nthat all projects from the current list will be completed within the medium-term horizon given \\nthe recent demand hit. Demand dynamics and global growth in petrochemicals have been attenu\\n-ated by the recent demand shock in the sector, but a rebound in the coming years and beyond the \\nmedium-term are expected, although at a slower pace than previously anticipated.\\nOil demand in the petrochemical sector of OPEC is set to continue focusing on the use of ethane \\nduring the forecast period. Out of a total sectoral growth of 1.6 mb/d between 2020 and 2045, \\nethane is forecast to increase by 1.1 mb/d. Some growth in the use of LPG (and marginally naph\\n-tha) is also expected in OPEC Member Countries with the development of new petrochemical \\n projects in OPEC™s African Member Countries.\\nIn the Middle East, ethane-cracking projects are under development in the IR Iran and the UAE. In \\nSaudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco and SABIC had intended to build the first OTC petrochemical plant in \\nYanbu, which was expected to produce nine million tonnes (mt) per year of chemicals and base oils. \\nHowever, with much lower demand after the outbreak of COVID-19, both companies announced \\ntheir intention to reassess the project and integrate the plant within the existing Yanbu refinery. \\nThe Yanbu OTC project is a manifestation of the future need to incorporate increased resilience \\nand flexibility to meet very dynamic demand in the refinery business. This is expected to be done \\nvia integrating petrochemical production in refining systems and OTC developments, which will \\nrepresent a viable alternative for the future petrochemical and refining industries.\\nFigure 3.21 summarizes regional trends in the petrochemical industry from the perspective of \\nmajor oil products, mainly examining feedstock, but also for energy use. In the period from 2020Œ\\n2035, demand for all feedstock increases at the global level. The largest increase is seen for \\nethane use in OPEC and OECD Americas at around 0.7 mb/d in each region. Significant growth is \\nalso projected for naphtha, mainly in Other Asia and China. The total increase in naphtha use is \\n 1 mb/d, while LPG and other products combined are projected to increase by only 0.3 mb/d.\\nThis pattern changes significantly during the last ten years of the forecast period. By then, demand \\nfor all products in the OECD petrochemical sector are anticipated to be in decline. Overall growth \\n130\\nin Other Asia and China is forecast to drop 0.3 mb/d and 0.2 mb/d, respectively. A somewhat larger \\ndemand increase is projected for OPEC Member Countries, where ethane is set to expand by an \\nadditional 0.4 mb/d and LPG adds another 0.1 mb/d.3.2.5 Other sectors \\nThe overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on oil demand in the \\nresidential, commercial and \\nagricultural\\n grouping was less pronounced. The main reason is that these sectors are combined \\nin the Outlook, thus some demand shift from the commercial to the residential sector is not visible \\nin cumulative numbers. Certainly the pandemic has increased teleworking and changed house\\n-hold behaviour. This gave rise to additional demand for electricity in residences, space heating/\\ncooling, and the extended use of home appliances. On the other hand, demand in the commer\\n-cial service and hospitality sectors declined sharply during the lockdown period and recovery \\nstage. However, the declining demand in the commercial building segment was offset by a surge \\nin the residential sector. To some extent, teleworking will likely continue for longer, since it offers \\nthe opportunity for businesses to cut operational costs. However, it remains to be seen what \\n proportion of it will be used to balance other business requirements.\\nAccording to recent projections, oil demand in this sector is set to increase steadily over the next \\n10Œ15 years and then decline at the end of the forecast period due to fuel switching, technology \\nand efficiency gains. This can be observed in Table 3.10, in which oil demand is forecast to increase \\nfrom 10.9 mb/d in 2020 to 12 mb/d by 2035, before declining to 11.6 mb/d in 2045.\\nOECD oil demand in this sector is set to remain relatively stable over the current decade, though \\nthe expected accelerated energy transition in the latter part of the forecast period is likely to result \\nin more oil substitution by electricity. Moreover, efficiency improvements and low-energy build\\n-ing codes form the foundation of OECD energy optimization in new buildings. The EU Commission \\npresented a plan in late 2020 to reduce energy consumption in inefficient buildings by 14% through \\nrevamps and retrofits. The plan involved efforts to further reduce heating and cooling energy use \\nby an even higher percentage (18%), which will affect oil demand in this sector. Similar regulations \\nalso exist in other OECD regions.\\nFigure 3.21\\nRegional demand in the petrochemical sector by product, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.21\\n202020352045202020352045202020352045202020352045OPECChinaOECD Americas Other Asia mb/d01234mb/dEthaneLPGNaphthaOther131\\nPart of the demand reduction is also due to the deployment of more efficient technologies like \\ndistrict heating, PV panels and heat pumps. Switching from oil to gas and electricity will further \\nimpact oil demand in this sector. However, oil use in agriculture will be more difficult to substitute. \\nConsidering these factors, OECD oil demand in this sector is estimated to decline by 1.4 mb/d to \\nreach 2.7 mb/d by 2045.\\nDriven strongly by urbanization and a rising middle class, oil use in the non-OECD is set to increase \\nin the long-term. Fuel-switching from solid biomass to oil-based products will drive oil demand \\nin sub-Saharan Africa, India and Southeast Asia, although the economic stress caused by the \\n pandemic compelled some households to revert back to traditional biomass cooking. \\nOil will also continue to support the provision for off-grid power in hard-to-access rural \\n settlements for household lighting, heating and cooling. Moreover, some households and com\\n-mercial buildings, mainly in West Africa, use gasoline-generated engines for the provision of elec\\n-tricity due to the unreliability of utility grid systems. Major oil use growth is driven by India and \\nChina for space heating, cooling and agriculture. Oil is used in the Middle East & Africa for space \\ncooling, cooking and lighting. \\nAs a result, non-OECD oil demand in the residential/commercial/agricultural sector is projected \\nto increase by 2.1 mb/d over the forecast period to 8.9 mb/d in 2045. \\nOil use in rail and domestic waterways\\n is the lowest among all sectors considered in this Outlook. \\nGlobal demand in this sector is just below 2 mb/d and is projected to move in a very narrow band \\naround 2 mb/d over the forecast period. Moreover, more than half of this demand is currently \\nconcentrated in only two regions, OECD Americas and China (Table 3.11). In the case of OECD \\nAmericas, the majority of the demand is linked to diesel used for rail transport. This is also the \\ncase for all other regions, with the exception of China, where a larger part of demand relates to \\ndomestic waterways.\\nGrowth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n1.7\\n1.7\\n1.7\\n1.8\\n1.7\\n1.6\\n1.1\\nŒ0.6\\nOECD Europe\\n1.6\\n1.5\\n1.5\\n1.5\\n1.3\\n1.1\\n1.1\\nŒ0.4\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n0.60.60.5\\nŒ0.5\\nOECD\\n4.1\\n4.1\\n4.0\\n4.0\\n3.7\\n3.3\\n2.7\\nŒ1.4\\nLatin America\\n0.8\\n0.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n1.2\\n0.4\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n0.60.60.7\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n0.5\\nIndia\\n1.1\\n1.0\\n1.3\\n1.4\\n1.6\\n1.7\\n1.8\\n0.8\\nChina\\n2.3\\n2.3\\n2.6\\n2.6\\n2.6\\n2.7\\n2.7\\n0.4\\nOther Asia\\n0.9\\n0.9\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.0\\nOPEC\\n0.60.60.60.60.60.60.60.0\\nRussia\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.0\\nOther Eurasia\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.3\\n0.0\\nNon-OECD\\n7.0\\n6.8\\n7.4\\n8.0\\n8.4\\n8.7\\n8.9\\n2.1\\nWorld\\n11.1\\n10.9\\n11.4\\n12.0\\n12.0\\n12.0\\n11.6\\n0.7\\nTable 3.10\\nOil demand in the residential/commercial/agriculture sector by region, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nmb/d\\n132\\nFrom a regional perspective, the highest demand base in this sector is in China. Part of this \\ndemand relates to the use of diesel in the railway system. Although the electrification rate in \\nChina is relatively high at around 70%, the remaining part of the railway system still provides a \\nsolid basis for oil demand, considering that the entire system comprises almost 150,000 km. For \\nfuture prospects, the electrification rate will likely further increase and most new Chinese rail\\n-ways will be built using electricity as the energy source. Therefore, oil demand in this sub-sector \\nwill remain relatively stable to slightly declining in the long-term.\\nThe opposite is expected for domestic waterways in China. Currently there are 127,000 km of \\ninland waterways in China and the country has a plan to expand this by a further 25,000 km in \\nthe period to 2035. This will lead to continuing growth in domestic waterway traffic in China, both \\nfor passengers and freight. More traffic, even accounting for better efficiencies in the future, will \\nprovide support to oil demand. The country™s combined rail and waterway oil demand growth is\\n estimated in the range of 0.2 mb/d between 2020 and 2045.\\nOil demand in the second largest-market for this sector will likely move in the opposite direc\\n-tion. Rail electrification in the US is not expected to increase significantly over the forecast period. \\nNeither is a significant increase expected for rail traffic. Therefore, oil demand is projected to \\nremain relatively stable during the current decade. However, some shifts are to be expected after\\n-wards, due to improved efficiencies and some oil substitution, for example, by hydrogen. \\nMinor demand growth is projected in other non-OECD countries, in particular Latin America, \\nOther Asia and Russia. However, projected demand growth in all these regions is below 0.1 mb/d.\\nAlthough electricity demand remained resilient during the pandemic, the use of oil for \\nelectric\\n-ity generation\\n continues to trend in the previously established negative trajectory. This is also \\nreflected in this Outlook, which expects the further displacement of oil by gas and renewables, \\nin line with major policy initiatives. It is worth noting that electricity generation remains the only \\n sector where oil use will decline at the global level over the forecast period.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nTable 3.11\\nOil demand in the rail and domestic waterways sector by region, \\n2019Œ2045Growth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.4\\n0.3\\nŒ0.2\\nOECD Europe\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nOECD\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n0.7\\n0.7\\n0.6\\n0.6\\n0.5Œ0.3\\nLatin America\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.1\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\nIndia\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nChina\\n0.60.60.7\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.2\\nOther Asia\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.1\\nOPEC\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nRussia\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\nOther Eurasia\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\nNon-OECD\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n1.2\\n1.3\\n1.4\\n1.5\\n1.6\\n0.5World\\n1.9\\n1.8\\n2.0\\n2.0\\n2.1\\n2.1\\n2.0\\n0.2\\nmb/d\\n133\\nIndeed, global oil demand for electricity generation is projected to contract by 1 mb/d and reach \\n3.9 mb/d in 2045 (Table 3.12). Most of this decline will be in the OECD region, where the fast-\\n progressing expansion of wind, both offshore and onshore, solar and geothermal energy, mainly \\nin OECD Europe, and the availability of relatively cheap gas is set to almost completely eliminate \\nthe use of oil in the sector.

On one side, several OPEC Member Countries \\nintend to reduce the direct use of crude oil for power generation in order to benefit from the higher \\nadded value of available oil resources. On the other side, part of this decline will be offset by the \\nincreased use of diesel and fuel oil for power generation, especially in African countries. The net \\nresult is estimated to be a decline of 0.3 mb/d between 2020 and 2045.\\nThe above demand decline will be partly compensated by increased oil use in off-grid captive power \\ngeneration in the Middle East & Africa region, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The global push to \\nachieve SDG7 Œ which seeks to expand energy access and clean cooking fuel for all by 2030 Œ is assist\\n-ing sub-Saharan Africa (and other regions) to further alleviate energy poverty. This is providing some \\nmomentum for the growth of oil-based generation via rural electrification in remote locations without \\ngas supply infrastructure. Consequently, oil demand for electricity generation in non-OECD regions is \\nset to grow during the current decade and marginally decline at the end of the forecast period.\\nContrary to electricity generation, much higher base consumption and positive incremental \\ndemand is projected for the \\n‚other industry™\\n sector. This covers a wide range of sub-sectors such \\nas iron and steel, glass and cement production, construction and mining and internal refinery use. \\nThus, consumption in this sector results from often-diverging trends at the regional and product \\nlevels, with plentiful options for fuel substitution, even on a temporary basis.\\nRegional prospects for future oil demand in this sector are presented in Table 3.13. These are \\nbroadly similar to those discussed earlier for the residential, commercial and agricultural sector, \\n134\\nalthough the weighting of contributing regions differs. Common features are growing global \\ndemand until around 2035 and declining demand thereafter, along with steadily declining OECD \\ndemand and expanding demand in the non-OECD region. \\nBesides these major trends, Table 3.13 also reflects the link between oil consumption in this sector \\nand its relative contribution to the GDP of respective countries/regions. Clearly, the largest incremen\\n-tal demand is expected in countries with growing industrialization, which typically supports the con\\n-sumption of diesel, residual fuel and LPG. This goes hand-in-hand with urbanization and the rapid \\nexpansion of necessary infrastructure, which, in turn, will support demand for asphalt, bitumen and \\nother related products. This is the case for India, the Middle East & Africa, OPEC and Other Asia.\\nChina represents another stage of economic development, in which the industrial sector contri\\n-bution starts to decline. This trend is expected to accelerate in the coming years. However, some \\nexpansion of road infrastructure will partially offset this decline, so that the net result is a decline \\nof around 0.2 mb/d during the forecast period.\\nAt the other end of the scale are OECD countries where the weight of the industrial sector is \\nshrinking and fuel consumption is switching towards natural gas. This sector is also seeing tech\\n-nology and policy-driven efficiency improvements. The road network in these countries is already \\nwell developed and only limited expansion is required. Therefore, OECD oil demand in the ‚other \\nindustry™ sector will steadily decline over the forecast period. The range of the decline is expected \\nto be around 1.2 mb/d between 2020 and 2045.\\nTable 3.13\\nOil demand in the ‚other industry™ sector by region, \\n2019Œ2045Growth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045OECD Americas\\n3.0\\n2.9\\n3.0\\n3.0\\n2.8\\n2.5\\n2.3\\nŒ0.7\\nOECD Europe\\n1.5\\n1.4\\n1.4\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n1.3\\nŒ0.2\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.8\\n0.7\\n0.7\\n0.60.5\\nŒ0.4\\nOECD\\n5.3\\n5.3\\n5.2\\n5.0\\n4.8\\n4.3\\n4.0\\nŒ1.2\\nLatin America\\n0.9\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n0.3\\nMiddle East & Africa\\n0.60.60.60.7\\n0.8\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.3\\nIndia\\n1.0\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n1.3\\n1.4\\n1.5\\n0.6China\\n1.92.1\\n2.0\\n2.1\\n2.0\\n2.0\\n1.9Œ0.2\\nOther Asia\\n0.9\\n0.9\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n1.1\\n1.1\\n1.2\\n0.3\\nOPEC\\n1.3\\n1.2\\n1.4\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n1.5\\n0.3\\nRussia\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.60.60.60.1\\nOther Eurasia\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.1\\nNon-OECD\\n7.6\\n7.4\\n7.9\\n8.5\\n8.8\\n9.1\\n9.2\\n1.8\\nWorld\\n12.9\\n12.7\\n13.1\\n13.5\\n13.7\\n13.4\\n13.3\\n0.6\\nmb/d\\nSource: OPEC.\\n3.3 Oil demand outlook by product\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered demand for specific refined products. Since the \\npandemic strongly impacted mobility, the largest demand decline in 2020 was observed in jet fuel, \\ngasoline and diesel. These products were disproportionally affected, each in a range between \\n2 mb/d and 3 mb/d, compared with other products, which declined by 0.2 mb/d to 0.4 mb/d. \\nMoreover, prospects for demand recovery vary across products. While demand for products like \\nnaphtha, LPG and most heavy products will likely recover in most regions as soon as 2021, diesel \\n135\\ndemand is expected to be back to pre-pandemic levels only sometime in 2022, gasoline most likely \\nin 2023 and jet kerosene only in 2024.\\nClearly, these expectations will to a large extent determine demand for refined products during \\nthe medium-term and will have some implications on long-term prospects, though these will be \\ndriven rather by various policy measures, fuel substitution options and efficiency improvements \\nthan short-term developments. For these reasons, it is important to consider medium- and long-\\nterm trends separately.\\nA summary of results on global product demand are presented in Table 3.14. Figure 3.22 shows \\ndemand growth broken down to the medium-term period (2020Œ2026) and the remaining part of \\nthe forecast period (2027Œ2045). The first important difference between the two periods is that all \\ntypes of refined products are projected to grow during the medium-term. This is primarily due \\nto very low demand seen in 2020, which provides ample room for growth. The same argument \\nexplains in part the large differences, except for naphtha, between growth in the medium- and \\nlong-term. Another issue of note is that gasoline and heavy products will see negative growth in \\nthe long-term, while the demand increase for diesel/gasoil will be minimal.\\nTable 3.14\\nGlobal oil demand by product, \\n2019Œ2045Growth\\n20192020202520302035204020452020Œ2045Ethane/LPG\\n12.7\\n12.2\\n13.7\\n14.7\\n15.1\\n15.3\\n15.2\\n3.0\\nNaphtha\\n6.3\\n6.0\\n6.8\\n7.2\\n7.6\\n7.9\\n8.2\\n2.2\\nGasoline\\n26.5\\n23.8\\n27.6\\n27.7\\n27.4\\n27.2\\n27.1\\n3.3\\nLight products\\n45.5\\n42.0\\n48.1\\n49.6\\n50.1\\n50.4\\n50.4\\n8.4\\nJet/kero\\n7.6\\n4.4\\n7.9\\n8.4\\n9.0\\n9.5\\n9.9\\n5.5\\nGasoil/diesel\\n28.4\\n26.3\\n29.0\\n29.5\\n29.8\\n29.7\\n29.6\\n3.3\\nMiddle distillates\\n36.0\\n30.7\\n37.0\\n38.0\\n38.8\\n39.1\\n39.5\\n8.9\\nResidual fuel\\n7.2\\n6.8\\n7.2\\n7.4\\n7.3\\n7.2\\n7.0\\n0.2\\nOther products\\n11.3\\n11.1\\n11.4\\n11.6\\n11.7\\n11.4\\n11.2\\n0.1\\nHeavy products\\n18.5\\n17.9\\n18.5\\n19.0\\n19.0\\n18.6\\n18.3\\n0.3\\nWorld\\n100.0\\n90.6\\n103.6\\n106.6\\n107.9\\n108.1\\n108.2\\n17.6\\nmb/d\\nSource: OPEC.\\nTurning to specific products, growing demand for ethane/LPG reflects trends in the petrochemical, \\nresidential and industrial sectors. Since these sectors are projected to grow, demand for ethane \\nand LPG will also expand during both the medium- and long-term periods. A similar pattern \\napplies to naphtha, which is primarily used as a feedstock for the petrochemical industry. Since \\nthis industry is projected to grow over the entire forecast period, incremental demand for naphtha \\nin the long-term will be even higher than in the medium-term. From a regional perspective, incre\\n-mental demand for naphtha will be concentrated in Asian countries, with the largest increments \\nprojected for Other Asia (+0.7 mb/d), China (+0.6 mb/d) and India (+0.5 mb/d).\\nDiffering from naphtha, gasoline demand growth is mostly concentrated in the medium-term \\nperiod. Demand for this product will increase by almost 4 mb/d between 2020 and 2026, and \\na large part of this will be absorbed by demand recovery in the road transportation sector. \\n136\\nFigure 3.22\\nGrowth in global oil demand by product\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.22\\nmboe/dGrowth 2020Œ2026Growth 2027Œ2045Œ1012345Ethane/LPGNaphthaGasolineJet/KeroGasoil/DieselResidual fuelOtherproductsmb/dThereafter, demand for gasoline is set to peak towards the end of the current decade. In 2045, it \\nis expected to be around 0.6 mb/d, lower than in 2026. This is a result of broad trends in the pas\\n-senger car segment, where improving fuel efficiencies and the increasing penetration of AFVs, \\nprimarily EVs, more than offset the potential demand increase resulting from an expansion in the \\nnumber of vehicles.\\nDemand for jet/kerosene also grows over the entire forecast period, but its increase during the \\n2020Œ2026 period is almost double that projected for 2027Œ2045. Clearly, this is due to the sharp \\ndecline in jet fuel in 2020. The same argument holds for diesel/gasoil demand, although propor\\n-tions between the two periods differ. In the case of diesel/gasoil, demand is expected to peak \\nsometime around 2035 and decline over the last ten years of the forecast period, which will offset \\npart of the growth between 2027 and 2035. \\nFor the remaining part of refined products, primarily the heavy part of the refined barrel, projected \\nchanges are minimal. Generally, some growth during the medium-term period, in the range of \\n 0.4 mb/d each for residual fuel oil and ‚other products™, will be largely offset over the long-term, \\nwith it ending the forecast period at slightly higher levels than recorded in 2020.\\nThe net effect of these trends for the entire forecast period is presented in Figure 3.23. With 2020 \\nas the base year for the Outlook, the largest incremental product demand is projected for jet fuel \\nand domestic kerosene, although in fact demand for domestic kerosene is seen to marginally \\ndecline. The total demand increase for this group of products stands at 5.5 mb/d between 2020 \\nand 2045.This is followed by diesel/gasoil and gasoline, contributing almost the same volume at 3.3 mb/d \\nand 3.2 mb/d, respectively. Incremental demand for ethane/LPG is projected at 2.9 mb/d and \\nnaphtha is at 2.2 mb/d. Finally, only marginal growth of 0.3 mb/d is projected for the combined \\ndemand of residual fuel and ‚other products™ between 2020 and 2045.\\n137\\nFigure 3.23\\nDemand growth by product category between 2020 and 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 3.23\\nmboe/dDemandin 2020Growth in light productsGrowth in middledistillatesGrowth in heavyproductsDemandin 204580838689929598101104107110mb/d90.6108.2Gasoline 3.3Naphtha 2.2Ethane/LPG 3.0Jet/Kero 5.5Gasoil/Diesel 3.3Other products 0.1Residual fuel 0.2138\\nLiquids supply\\n139\\nKey takeaways\\nŁ Non-OPEC liquids supply is expected to continue its recovery, growing y-o-y in 2021 and \\nreturning to pre-pandemic levels in 2022. \\nŁ As oil demand picks up, aided by the surging global economy and the market \\n stabilization efforts of OPEC and non-OPEC countries in the DoC, market fundamentals \\nare anticipated to remain stable and supportive, thus encouraging a return to upstream \\n activity and investment. \\nŁ Medium-term non-OPEC total liquids supply is projected to grow by 7.5 mb/d, from \\n 62.9 mb/d in 2020 to 70.4 mb/d in 2026. Key contributors to growth in this period are the \\nUS, Brazil, Russia, Guyana, Canada, Kazakhstan, Norway and Qatar. \\nŁ US crude oil production, which slumped as the COVID-19 pandemic hit, quickly recovered \\nsome of its losses in the latter part of 2020. US total liquids supply in 2021 is expected \\nto be relatively flat as producers remain cautious, but supportive market fundamentals \\nshould incentivize a return to growth from 2022. \\nŁ US tight oil is projected to grow from 11.5 mb/d in 2020 to 14.8 mb/d in 2026, before peak\\n-ing around 15.2 mb/d in the late 2020s Œ around 0.6 mb/d lower than expected in the WOO \\n2020. As a result, US total liquids, which are expected to grow from 17.6 mb/d in 2020 to \\n 20.5 mb/d in 2026, peak and plateau shortly afterwards, and then decline to 16.9 mb/d by \\n2045. \\nŁ In the long-term, after US liquids supply peaks, only a few non-OPEC producers are \\nexpected to see output growth, including Canada, Guyana, Kazakhstan, Brazil and Qatar, \\nin addition to refinery processing gains. Therefore, due to the decline in the US and in \\nmaturing producers such as post-peak Norway, China, Colombia, Azerbaijan, the UK and \\nIndonesia, among others, total non-OPEC liquids supply is set to decline from 70.4 mb/d \\nin 2026 to 65.5 mb/d in 2045, basically level with pre-pandemic 2019 (though higher than \\ndepressed 2020). \\nŁ OPEC liquids supply is forecast to recover from a pandemic-induced 2020 low of \\n 30.7 mb/d, increasing as demand recovers. Levels are projected to rise quickly to around \\n34 mb/d in the 2023Œ2026 period. Beyond that, as non-OPEC liquids supply plateaus and \\npeaks in the late 2020s, OPEC liquids begin to increase again, growing from 35.7 mb/d in \\n2030 to 42.7 mb/d in 2045. In terms of market share, relative to global liquids supply, this \\nimplies a rise from 33% at the nadir in 2020 to 39% in 2045. \\nŁ The average API gravity of global crude supply is expected to increase to 33.7° in 2025 \\ndue to rising light production, then decline to around 33.2° by 2045. This is in line with the \\nlonger-term rising share of heavier grades, mostly from the Middle East. \\nŁ Cumulative investment requirements in the oil sector amount to $11.8 trillion in the \\n2021Œ2045 period. The upstream accounts for some 80% of this, or $9.2 trillion, the bulk \\nof which is in North America, as US tight oil, in particular, drives medium-term non-\\nOPEC supply growth. The downstream and midstream need another $1.5 trillion and \\n $1.1 trillion, respectively, in order to expand and maintain the associated refinery, \\n storage and pipeline systems that bring oil to the market. \\n140\\nThis chapter describes the outlook for liquids supply from 2020Œ2045. As in previous Outlooks, the \\nmedium-term projections for 2020Œ2026 and the longer-term outlook are discussed separately, \\ndue to the different methodologies employed. The medium-term view relies upon a bottom-up \\napproach, identifying upstream project start-ups, their progress and the underlying decline in \\nmature fields, while the long-term outlook is based upon an assessment of the available resource \\nbase. US tight oil is also modelled and discussed separately.\\nDue to the distorting effect of large-scale supply shut-ins in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19\\n pandemic, the tables in this year™s Outlook will also include production figures for 2019. This \\nallows for a better comparison with previous WOOs and other forecasts. \\n4.1 Global liquids supply\\nThe repercussions of and recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to shape \\nglobal liquids supply. While OPEC and its partners in the DoC agreed in April 2020 to adjust down \\nproduction by nearly 10 mb/d, other producers also took, or were forced to take, measures to limit \\noutput until demand began to return. As a result, non-OPEC liquids supply declined by 2.6 mb/d in \\n2020, of which just over half was in DoC participating countries.\\nTable 4.1\\nMedium-term global liquids supply outlook\\nmb/d\\n20192020202120222023202420252026Change2020Œ2026US18.4\\n17.6\\n17.7\\n18.4\\n19.3\\n19.9\\n20.3\\n20.5\\n2.9\\n of which: tight liquids\\n11.7\\n11.5\\n11.6\\n12.3\\n13.3\\n14.0\\n14.5\\n14.8\\n3.3\\nCanada\\n5.4\\n5.2\\n5.5\\n5.6\\n5.6\\n5.6\\n5.6\\n5.6\\n0.4\\n of which: oil sands\\n2.9\\n2.8\\n3.0\\n3.1\\n3.1\\n3.2\\n3.2\\n3.1\\n0.3\\nOECD Americas\\n25.8\\n24.7\\n25.1\\n26.0\\n26.9\\n27.4\\n27.8\\n27.9\\n3.2\\nOECD Europe\\n3.7\\n3.9\\n3.9\\n4.1\\n4.4\\n4.5\\n4.4\\n4.2\\n0.3\\n of which: Norway\\n1.7\\n2.0\\n2.1\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n2.5\\n2.4\\n2.3\\n0.3\\nOECD Asia Oceania\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.60.60.60.60.60.1\\nOECD\\n30.0\\n29.1\\n29.6\\n30.7\\n31.9\\n32.5\\n32.8\\n32.7\\n3.6\\nLatin America\\n6.1\\n6.0\\n6.2\\n6.5\\n6.8\\n7.17.5\\n8.0\\n1.9 of which: Brazil\\n3.6\\n3.7\\n3.8\\n4.0\\n4.2\\n4.5\\n4.8\\n5.0\\n1.3\\nMiddle East\\n3.2\\n3.2\\n3.2\\n3.3\\n3.3\\n3.3\\n3.4\\n3.5\\n0.3\\nAfrica\\n1.5\\n1.4\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n1.3\\n1.4\\n1.5\\n1.6\\n0.2\\nChina\\n4.0\\n4.1\\n4.2\\n4.3\\n4.3\\n4.3\\n4.2\\n4.1\\n0.0\\nOther Asia\\n3.5\\n3.3\\n3.2\\n3.2\\n3.1\\n3.1\\n3.1\\n3.1\\nŒ0.2\\nRussia\\n11.6\\n10.6\\n10.6\\n11.1\\n11.2\\n11.3\\n11.4\\n11.4\\n0.9\\nOther Eurasia\\n3.2\\n3.0\\n3.1\\n3.1\\n3.3\\n3.4\\n3.4\\n3.4\\n0.3\\nNon-OECD\\n33.2\\n31.6\\n31.9\\n32.8\\n33.3\\n33.9\\n34.5\\n35.1\\n3.5\\nProcessing gains\\n2.4\\n2.2\\n2.3\\n2.4\\n2.4\\n2.5\\n2.5\\n2.6\\n0.4\\nNon-OPEC\\n65.5\\n62.9\\n63.8\\n65.9\\n67.6\\n68.8\\n69.8\\n70.4\\n7.5\\nTotal OPEC liquids\\n34.6\\n30.7\\n30.9\\n33.8\\n34.0\\n34.0\\n34.0\\n34.1\\n3.5\\nWorld*\\n100.0\\n93.6\\n94.7\\n99.7\\n101.6\\n102.8\\n103.8\\n104.6\\n10.9\\n* The sum of the countries/regions may not add up to the global supply total due to rounding and stock change assumptions.\\nSource: OPEC.\\n141\\nSubsequently, as vaccination programmes and other remedies began to beat back the pandemic, \\neconomic recovery picked up speed in 2021, and after stabilizing, non-OPEC liquids have started \\nto grow again.

In the US, crude production has stabilized again above 11 mb/d.\\nWith the global economy and oil demand expected to reach pre-pandemic levels during the course \\nof 2021 and 2022, and keep growing thereafter, non-OPEC liquids supply is projected to expand \\nby 7.5 mb/d from 2020Œ2026, rising from 62.9 mb/d in 2020 to 70.4 mb/d by the end of this period \\n(Table 4.1).

DoC discipline has steadily helped draw down the previous massive stock \\noverhang, and oil prices have been consistently above $50/b since early 2021. Perhaps more \\nimportantly, expectations are for continued stability in oil markets, allowing for more optimism \\nand medium- and long-term planning by oil companies. As a result, shut-in production continues \\nto recover, capital expenditure in the upstream is rising again, and, despite some delays, new pro\\n-jects are being given the go-ahead.\\nAt the same time, major developed and emerging economies are beginning to make increasingly \\nstrong commitments to reduce CO\\n2 emissions in the coming decades, many even committing to ‚net-\\nzero™ emissions by around 2050. How precisely this will affect the upstream sector and liquids supply \\nis as yet unclear. It is safe to say, however, that it has triggered debate and heightened concern about \\npotential medium-term oil market tightness, as well as longer-term investment into the sector.\\nThe change in policy direction is underpinned by a range of other more specific and nearer-term \\ndevelopments. In the US, the new Biden administration initially imposed a number of executive \\norders, including temporary moratoria on new lease sales and on drilling on federal lands (sub\\n-sequently challenged). The administration effectively cancelled the disputed Keystone XL pipeline, \\nwhile other pipeline projects remain in doubt or suspended. Meanwhile, highly-publicized votes \\nat shareholder meetings of a number of super-majors, and a court decision ordering Royal Dutch \\nShell to accelerate its pace of decarbonization, have in some quarters been seen as heralding in \\nthe beginning of the end for oil, or fossil fuels, in general. \\nNonetheless, this Outlook™s Reference Case assumes that only some of these measures will be \\nimplemented in the medium- to long-term, and not comprehensively across both developed and \\nFigure 4.1\\nLong-term non-OPEC liquids supply outlook\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.1\\nmboe/d01020304050607080902015202020252030203520402045OECD AmericasOECD EuropeOECD Asia OceaniaOther AsiaLatin AmericaMiddle EastAfricaEurasiaChinaProcessing gainsmb/d143\\nFigure 4.2\\nComposition of long-term global liquids supply growth, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\ndeveloping economies. Even with emissions curbs and other efforts to reduce the use of fossil \\nfuels, oil will remain an important part of the energy mix for years to come. \\nAs a result, non-OPEC liquids supply will continue to grow throughout the 2020s, before plateauing \\naround the turn of the decade with a high point of around 71 mb/d. The main reason will be a projected \\npeak in US liquids supply at just over 20 mb/d, of which tight liquids will make up around 15 mb/d, or \\naround 14% of global supply. With only a few sources of long-term non-OPEC supply growth Œ includ\\n-ing notably Brazil, Guyana, Canada, Russia and Kazakhstan Œ the natural decline in most other non-\\nOPEC producers is expected to see total non-OPEC supply falling to 65.5 mb/d by 2045 (Figure 4.2). \\nAs a result, total OPEC liquids is forecast to first recover to around pre-pandemic levels of \\n 34.1 mb/d in the medium-term, before growing to 42.7 mb/d in the long-term. \\n4.2 Drivers of medium-term and long-term liquids supply\\nLifted by a wave of optimism and economic growth, a resulting demand recovery, and a supportive \\nmarket environment as the world gradually overcomes the COVID-19 pandemic, non-OPEC liq\\n-uids supply is set to rebound. On a quarterly basis, non-OPEC liquids supply had already stabilized \\naround mid-2020 and has grown modestly since. On an annual basis, liquids supply in 2020 aver\\n-aged 62.9 mb/d and is set to recover to 63.8 mb/d in 2021. Thereafter, growth is projected to pick \\nup, with supply rising by 2.1 mb/d in 2022 and an average 1.1 mb/d p.a. in the remainder of the \\nmedium-term, reaching 70.4 mb/d by 2026.\\nThe key drivers behind this projected growth are visible signs of near-term recovery. For exam\\n-ple, shut-in production resuming; rig counts, drilling and fracking activity rising; and upstream \\ninvestment returning, albeit cautiously. According to Wood Mackenzie, the number of final \\ninvestment decisions on new field start-ups is now assessed at around 30 for 2021, up from \\njust 12 in 2020. Moreover, profitability has returned, with equity valuations (for publicly-traded \\nFigure 4.2\\nmboe/dGlobal 2020USNorwayChinaColombiaMexicoIndonesiaOther non-OPECQatarKazakhstanRussiaCanadaGuyanaBrazilProcessing gainsOPEC liquidsGlobal 2045UK889092949698100102104106108110mb/d144\\nFigure 4.3\\nCost of drilling US oil & gas wells (January 2010 = 100)\\nSource: US Bureau of Labor Statistics.\\nFigure 4.3\\nmboe/dGlobal 20458090100110120130140150201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021oil companies) having jumped on bumper quarterly results. The resulting dividend pay-outs \\nand share buybacks make the entire E&P sector one of the success stories of the year so far, \\ndespite the headwinds from an increased investor and media focus on the energy transition and \\nESG concerns.\\nFurthermore, the shock of sharply lower oil prices triggered by the unprecedented huge, albeit \\ntemporary, drop in oil demand in 2Q20 kept pressure on costs (Figure 4.3), bringing down break-\\neven prices. The slashing of overheads and head counts, further efficiency gains in the design \\nstage of upstream projects, pressure on oil service companies, and in some cases, lower energy \\nand other costs have resulted in significant savings for oil companies. Now that oil prices have \\nrecovered, even while belts have effectively remained tightened, companies are enjoying bumper \\nresults. Oil demand is evidently making a strong recovery, and based on the assumption that \\noil markets will remain relatively stable and supportive this is expected to result in continued \\ninvestment. \\nGiven the usual assessment of medium-term project start-ups that are either already \\n confirmed or expected to receive a final investment decision (FID) in the near-term, the out\\n-look is for a strong recovery in non-OPEC liquids supply, with pre-pandemic levels already \\nattained (on an annual basis) in 2022. From 62.9 mb/d in 2020, production is expected to grow \\nto 70.4 mb/d in 2026, or by an average 1.25 mb/d p.a. After only modest growth in 2021, incre\\n-mental supply in 2022 is expected to be strong, at 2.1 mb/d, as the recovery in US tight oil sup\\n-ply picks up pace, and as non-OPEC countries in the DoC continue to return shut-in capacity \\nto the market.\\nDespite some delays, new project start-ups in countries such as Brazil, Canada, newcomer \\nGuyana, Russia, Kazakhstan and Qatar are set to contribute to healthy long-term non-OPEC liq\\n-uids supply. Most other non-OPEC producers Œ including Norway, China, Colombia, the UK, Mexico \\nand Indonesia Œ are expected to experience declining output over the long-term. Analysis of the \\nsum of non-OPEC upstream projects that have experienced delays (relative to start-up dates \\n145\\nassumed before the COVID-19 pandemic hit) indicates substantial affected volumes. Of a total of \\n3.4 mb/d, around half, or 1.7 mb/d, were postponed by one year, some 0.8 mb/d by two years, and \\nthe rest by three-to-four years (Figure 4.4).\\nFigure 4.4\\nNon-OPEC liquids supply: select upstream project start-up delays*\\n* Figure shows the number of years by which project start-ups have been delayed, comparing the WOO 2021 assessment with that \\nof pre-pandemic WOO 2019.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.4\\nmboe/dŒ1.8Œ1.6Œ1.4Œ1.2Œ1.0Œ0.8Œ0.6Œ0.4Œ0.201 year2 years3 years4 yearsmb/dOECD EuropeOECD AsiaOECD EuropeOECD AmericasMiddle EastLatin AmericaEurasiaChinaAsiaAfricaBox 4.1\\nSupply crunch on the horizon?\\nAs oil markets recover swiftly from the pandemic-induced slump, warnings of an impending \\nor eventual oil supply crunch surface periodically. The premise is that, as oil demand rebounds \\npost-pandemic, investment in new oil supply fails to keep pace. The result would be a future \\nperiod of pronounced market tightness; a bust followed by a boom. It would also lead to wide\\n-spread volatility and uncertainty, which is in the interest of neither producers nor consumers. \\nLooking beyond the next couple of years, some voices are increasingly pointing towards the \\nenergy transition and the potential for a long-term, structural supply crunch, due to the pol\\n-icy implications of a push towards the use of more renewables (and subsequently less fossil \\nfuels) in the energy mix. \\nAlready, some investors, activists and companies are highlighting the need to limit invest\\n-ment in what they term ‚stranded assets™, or assets deemed to have ESG concerns. The \\nrisk is that withholding investments in the medium- and long-term could lead to a disor\\n-derly, volatile and one-sided transition, even while Œ as this Outlook projects Œ the world will \\n continue to need oil for the foreseeable future.\\n146\\nHowever, while there is a possibility of production falling short Œ indeed, supply sensitivity mod\\n-elling in Chapter 8 presents a potential Lower Supply Case in detail, without assigning any prob\\n-ability to this happening Œ there are a number of reasons to believe that this is unlikely to occur.\\nThe key question in the short- to medium-term is whether upstream investment will be \\nsufficient. Indeed, one of the main reasons this issue has resurfaced is due to the fact that \\ncapital expenditure in 2020 was down by 28%, from around $330 billion in 2019, to only \\n$240 billion in 2020, according to Rystad Energy (Figure 1). Wood Mackenzie, similarly, esti\\n-mates that spending was down by 28% in 2020. The outlook for 2021 is uncertain, but Wood \\nMackenzie projects that upstream spending will rise again, by a modest 4%, picking up to \\n10% in 2022. Rystad Energy thinks a recovery will take longer, seeing very flat spending in \\n2021Œ2022, and a more sizeable rise of 11% only in 2023.\\nHowever, there is a risk of extrapolating too much from one data point. Arguably, there was \\nsignificant cost inflation in the years before total spending reached a high point in 2014. Even \\nat its reduced level, estimated spending in 2020 roughly matches that of 2006Œ2007, by no \\nmeans a low point for supply growth. Moreover, while in 2016, following two successive years \\nof 26% drops in upstream investment, non-OPEC liquids supply did decline by 0.8 mb/d, it \\nrebounded by the same amount in the subsequent year. Thereafter, it expanded by a stun\\n-ning 5 mb/d in 2018Œ2019, before COVID-19 struck, even though upstream investment only \\nrose more gradually compared to earlier periods. \\nA key characteristic of commodity markets is their cyclicality, and eventually, any supply \\nshortfall, if it emerges, typically results in higher prices, which in turn stimulates more \\ninvestment again. Thus, in oil™s 150-year history, there have been numerous boom and bust \\ncycles. \\nIn any case, in the short- to medium-term, before any investment-related supply tightness \\ncould emerge, OPEC Members and other countries participating in the DoC still have spare \\nFigure 1\\nGlobal upstream capital expenditure (oil only); non-OPEC liquids supply\\nSource: Rystad Energy, OPEC.\\nBox Figure 4.1\\nmboe/d30354045505560657075808505010015020025030035040045050055020002002200420062008201020122014201620182020202220242026mb/d$ (2021) billionUpstream investmentNon-OPEC supply [RHS]147\\ncapacity, even as they gradually unwind production adjustments made at the onset of the \\nCOVID-19 crisis. An agreement struck in July 2021 extended the arrangement through the \\nend of 2022, formalizing the return of the adjustments in a timely fashion as demand recov\\n-ers, even while leaving open the option to continually re-adjust, should the need occur. Some \\nOPEC Member Countries are also in the course of expanding production capacity.\\nIn the longer-term, concerns about potential supply tightness rather stem from \\n expectations that policies enacted to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement will have a \\nbearing on the oil sector, in general, and the upstream, in particular. Besides plans to sig\\n-nificantly reduce emissions, as spelled out by the major G7 economies and China, as well as \\nothers, additional possible reforms include tightening environmental regulations surround\\n-ing the production, refining, transport and consumption of oil (such as future bans on ICEs \\nin some regions), carbon taxes, and similar. \\nAt least indirectly, this is already influencing some oil companies, with many of the western \\nmajors rolling out ambitious plans to reduce their own emissions, and to transition towards \\nbecoming a more integrated energy company, rather than specifically an oil company. In \\nmid-2021, a court decision ordering Royal Dutch Shell to cut its CO\\n2 emissions by 45% com\\n-pared to 2019 levels, in line with the Paris Agreement, and activist members being elected \\nto ExxonMobil™s board attracted much commentary. \\nHowever, this is arguably a very western, or even Eurocentric perspective, and drawing \\n conclusions that pressure on a certain cohort of companies will necessarily lead to lower \\ninvestments may be erroneous. It is so far mostly European major oil companies that have \\nbeen most vocal about their environmental credentials Œ US-based integrated oil compa\\n-nies have been noticeably more reticent, let alone Asian, Latin American or Russian ones. \\nMoreover, while publicly-traded companies must adhere to their shareholders™ wishes, the \\nsame is not true for national oil companies (NOCs), nor for privately-held companies, such \\nas US shale operators owned by private equity money. \\nMuch has also been made about some European banks™ reluctance to lend money for \\n projects they consider environmentally sensitive; but the same may not be true for large \\nfinancial institutions from elsewhere. Even those IOCs with ambitious environmental goals \\nare not planning to exit the oil and gas business entirely. \\nUltimately, this Outlook assumes Œ at least in the Reference Case Œ that there will be \\n continued demand for oil, even in the long-term, and that market mechanisms will ensure \\nthat it is attractive to invest in the required upstream capacity. It should also be recognized \\nthat in a case where world oil demand peaks or declines, oil will be needed. In fact, just to \\nkeep production flat requires significant investments to offset some 3Œ5 mb/d of natural \\ndecline p.a. due to mature fields seeing production drop off. \\nIn an interesting twist, after years of periodically warning of underinvestment in new oil \\nproduction capacity, the International Energy Agency (IEA) in large part triggered the more \\nrecent debate with the publication of its much-quoted ‚Net Zero by 2050™ report, which sug\\n-gested investment in new oil and gas fields would no longer be needed in a world that pushes \\nto achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. \\nIt is without doubt prudent to monitor investments and other factors that could herald \\n tightness in the upstream sector. This is a constant; it is what all forecasters and companies \\ndo. OPEC™s WOO 2021 continues to call for upstream investment to be sustained (see Section \\n4.6 in Chapter 4), given that oil demand continues to expand over most of the forecast period. \\n148\\n4.3 Liquids supply outlook by main regions\\nThe main driver of near-term recovery will be US tight oil, with particularly strong growth in the initial \\nyears of the medium-term, albeit from a lower base, as US crude oil saw the largest single shut-ins \\nwhen the pandemic hit. Despite some project delays, Brazil and Guyana are likely to see steady growth \\nin the next five years. DoC participants, Russia, Kazakhstan and others, are expected to return shut-in \\nproduction adjustment volumes to market, in addition to some new capacities being brought online. \\nLastly, stalwarts Canada, Norway and Qatar are also set to add meaningful volumes in the medium-\\nterm (Figure 4.5).\\nWith the likelihood of a supply crunch on the horizon quite low, undue pessimism may not be \\nhelpful. On the other hand, if necessary investments fail to materialize in the coming years, \\nfor one reason or another, this opinion may need to be revisited.\\nFigure 4.5\\nSelect contributors to non-OPEC total liquids change, 2020Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.5\\nUSBrazilRussiaGuyanaCanadaKazakhstanNorwayQatarMexicoIndonesiaColombiaUKProcessing gains2.91.30.90.60.40.40.30.30.3Œ0.1Œ0.1Œ0.1Œ0.1Œ0.500.51.01.52.02.53.03.5mb/dmboe/dBeyond the medium-term, the key shift in the non-OPEC liquids supply dynamic is the projected peak \\nand slow decline in US tight liquids supply beginning around 2030. Norway too will see declining out\\n-put. Otherwise, the drivers of growth in terms of countries are similar to the medium-term, albeit with \\nBrazil, Canada and Guyana more dominant. Most other non-OPEC producers are expected to see stag\\n-nation or slow long-term decline. \\nRegionally, this decline results in non-OPEC medium-term liquids supply growth taking place mainly \\nin OECD Americas, Latin America and Eurasia, and to a lesser extent in the Middle East, Africa and \\nOECD Europe. By contrast, in the long-term, OECD Americas is more or less flat, and major growth is \\nonly present in Latin America, Eurasia and the Middle East (Figure 4.6). \\n149\\nFigure 4.6\\nLong-term non-OPEC liquids supply outlook by region\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.6\\nmboe/d2045051015202530mb/d202020262045OECDAmericasOECDEuropeOECDAsiaOceaniaProcessinggainsOtherAsiaAfricaEurasiaLatinAmericaChinaMiddleEast4.3.1 Major countries\\nUSOutside of the DoC participating countries, the US saw the single largest (temporary) adjustment \\nto its liquids supply as a result of the pandemic-related price slump. Crude oil production fell from \\na 1Q20 average of 12.8 mb/d to below 10 mb/d by May 2020, although it picked up again to around \\n11 mb/d by the end of the year. On an annual average basis, 2020 crude production fell from \\n 12.2 mb/d in 2019 to 11.3 mb/d in 2020. Total liquids supply dropped from 18.4 mb/d in 2019 to \\n 17.6 mb/d in 2020, with lower crude partly offset by a modest increase in natural gas liquids \\n(NGLs) output. However, US tight crude and, consequently, total liquids supply, is expected to \\ngrow again in the coming years. While operators have remained highly disciplined in 2021, indi\\n-cations are for a return to growth from 2022. Rig counts continue to rise, more wells are being \\nfracked, more frac crews are being deployed, and with firms again flush with free cash flow, the \\noutlook is for a return to reinvesting more of these funds into new capacity. \\nIn essence, companies will soon be in a position to return cash to investors and invest in new \\ncapacity at the same time. As a result, the outlook is for US tight crude to rise from 7.3 mb/d in \\n2020 to 9.9 mb/d by 2026, with growth front-loaded (Figure 4.7). \\nBesides tight crude, conventional crude produced offshore in the Gulf of Mexico is also expected to \\nrebound over the medium-term, with several new fields coming online, albeit with some delayed \\ndue to the pandemic. The area also suffered from a powerful hurricane season in 2020, with large \\nvolumes temporarily shut-in. \\nNew capacities stem from the expansions of BP™s Atlantis and Thunder Horse complexes, add\\n-ing 35 tb/d and 50 tb/d, respectively, in 2021. A slew of new projects are expected in 2022, includ\\n-ing the large 120 tb/d Mad Dog 2 start-up (also BP), as well as the 80 tb/d Vito and King™s Quay \\ndevelopments, operated by Shell and Murphy, respectively. Towards the end of the medium-term \\nperiod, the 80 tb/d Anchor, Whale and North Platte fields are expected to come on-stream. \\nAs a result of these and other start-ups, US Gulf of Mexico offshore production is set to recover \\nfrom a low of 1.7 mb/d in 2020, rising to 1.8 mb/d in 2021 and nearly 2 mb/d in 2024. Thereafter, \\n150\\nproduction is expected to slowly decline again. Nonetheless, a long list of potential projects, if \\nsanctioned, and depending among other things on policy developments, could maintain Gulf of \\nMexico production at higher levels. \\nMeanwhile, various developments on the policy front have the potential to impact medium- and \\nlong-term US liquids supply. The Biden administration made waves by announcing several interim \\nmeasures, including the halt to leases and a moratorium on drilling (subsequently challenged) Œ \\nall on federal lands. It also halted the development of oil resources in the Alaska National Wildlife \\nRefuge (ANWR), a large tract of adjacent land to the east of current producing areas, and long off-\\nlimits to drillers. The Trump administration had given the green light to lease sales there in its \\nfinal days. Elsewhere, the disputed Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to Nebraska was cancelled after the \\nBiden administration revoked the previous administration™s approval. Other pipelines designed to \\nbring Canadian and/or tight oil from the Bakken in North Dakota south to refining hubs, notably \\nincluding the Line 3 expansion and Dakota Access pipelines, also remain uncertain.\\nWhile the ANWR was put off limits again for drillers (and in any case, no major E&P companies had \\nshown interest in bidding for leases), the Biden administration has given the go-ahead to the large \\nWillow field. Willow and some other related deposits are in an area called the National Petroleum \\nReserve in Alaska (NPR-A), a mostly untapped area to the west of the Alaska™s main producing \\nareas, and originally put aside as a strategic reserve for the Navy in the 1920s. Willow had received \\nthe go-ahead from the previous administration, but faced a setback in early 2021 following a federal \\ncourt decision related to an environmental lawsuit. Willow is a potentially large project, which with \\nsome related assets, could add up to 150 tb/d of new capacity in the latter half of the decade. \\nIn combination with the large Pikka field that is expected to come online from around mid-\\n decade and with a nameplate capacity of 100 tb/d, Alaska™s crude output, long in decline, could \\nexperience a bit of a resurgence. The state could recover 2020 production levels of 440 tb/d by \\n2026, growing to some 530 tb/d in the late 2020s, before declining again, unless other new large \\nfields are sanctioned. \\nFigure 4.7\\nUS total liquids supply outlook\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.7\\nmboe/d0246810121416182022200520102015202020252030203520402045mb/dTight crudeUnconventional NGLsGoM crudeAlaska crudeOther crudeConventional NGLsBiofuelsOther liquids151\\nIn the longer-term, the Biden administration has also recommitted to the Paris Agreement and has \\npublished plans to achieve full decarbonization of the power sector by 2035, and a fully ‚net-zero™ \\neconomy by 2050. Oil and gas producers will likely face higher taxes and royalties; tighter environ\\n-mental restrictions, especially regarding methane emissions and gas flaring; and eventually possi\\n-bly a CO\\n2 tax. \\nAt least in the medium-term, however, it remains questionable what, if any, impact these meas\\n-ures will have on US-based oil production. First of all, the halt to drilling and leasing were \\nonly intended to be temporary, and in mid-June, a court ruled that the leasing ban potentially \\n overstepped federal authority.\\nIt should be noted that only a relatively modest share of total oil and gas production activity \\nactually takes place on federal lands, at least onshore. According to the US Energy Information \\nAdministration (EIA), in 2019 oil produced on federal lands made up 22% of total output; the fig\\n-ure was 12% for natural gas Œ although the majority of this is produced offshore. According to the \\nBureau of Land Management (BLM), onshore acreage alone accounts for 8% of oil and 9% of gas \\nproduction in the US. \\nMoreover, even were a drilling ban to be implemented, tight oil producers in particular have large \\ninventories of drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs), as well as prime acreage already leased to \\nthem to fall back upon. S&P Platts estimated in January 2021 that a full ban on drilling on federal \\nlands could cut output by 1.1Œ1.6 mb/d. If the ban were only to apply to onshore territory, it would \\narguably take even longer to have an impact, due to existing leases and acreage held by compa\\n-nies, some of which is already pre-drilled.\\nIn sum, total US crude oil supply is set to decline from 11.3 mb/d in 2020 to 9.2 mb/d in 2045. By \\ncontrast, total NGLs (including the shale-derived unconventional type) is forecast to rise stead\\n-ily from 5.2 mb/d in 2020 to 6.5 mb/d in 2045. Total biofuels is anticipated to inch up marginally to \\n 1.2 mb/d, while other liquids (mostly refinery additives) is set to stay flat at 0.1Œ0.2 mb/d in this \\ntimeframe. As a result, US total liquids supply is projected to decline from 17.6 mb/d in 2020 \\nto 16.9 mb/d in 2045, after peaking at around 20.6 mb/d in the late 2020s (Table 4.3).

Some Albertan production was also \\nforced to shut-in as the provincial government mandated curtailments in an attempt to shore up \\ndifferentials \\nvis-à-vis US crude grades. However, these curtailments were phased out and finally \\ncame to an end in December 2020. \\nCanadian oil production has recovered so far in 2021 and over the medium-term period is expected \\nto grow from an average 5.2 mb/d in 2020 to 5.6 mb/d in 2026. The majority of this incremen\\n-tal supply stems from oil sands-derived production, even as conventional crude supplies decline \\nslowly. There is a degree of uncertainty over some large-scale conventional on- and offshore crude \\nupstream projects, including notably the 75 tb/d West White Rose field, offshore Newfoundland, \\nwith start-up now likely to be delayed until 2025, from 2022. The delay came after operator Husky \\nmerged with Cenovus Energy in late 2020, and the field™s scope and costs were re-evaluated.\\nThe Bay du Nord offshore field, which was also put on hold because of the pandemic, now looks \\nlikely to go ahead, with an FID expected in 2023/24, after increased drilling enlarged its reserves \\nbase significantly. It now has estimated reserves of nearly 1 billion barrels, while production \\ncapacity could be 150 tb/d, with output starting from 2028. The field is located in challenging \\n circumstances, in more than 1,000 metres of water and with drifting icebergs in the area. \\nIn the longer-term, the outlook is for further steady growth in liquids supply from Canadian oil \\nsands, with total output rising from 2.8 mb/d in 2020 to 3.1 mb/d in 2026, and to 4.1 mb/d by 2045. \\nThe revoking of the Keystone XL pipeline permit by the Biden administration is potentially a blow \\nto further export increases, but expectations are for sufficient offsets from other pipelines, even\\n-tual exports to Asia, and increased rail shipments. The possibility of mergers between railway \\noperators in the US and Canada may provide an extensive network to facilitate exports of Albertan \\noil to US Gulf Coast refiners. \\nGrowth in oil sands-derived production and a modest increase in NGLs output will, however, be \\npartly offset by continued declines in conventional crude. Total Canadian liquids production is thus \\nFigure 4.8\\nCanada total liquids supply outlook\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.8\\nmboe/d20450123456720192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045mb/dConventional crudeTight crudeConventional NGLsUnconventional NGLsBiofuelsOil sands153\\nexpected to rise from 5.2 mb/d in 2020 to 6.1 mb/d by 2045, providing one of the largest sources of \\nnon-OPEC liquids supply growth (Figure 4.8). \\nMexico\\nMexico™s total liquids supply is projected to stay flat at around 1.9 mb/d over the course of the medium-\\nterm. National oil company Pemex is scheduled to bring on-stream a string of smaller develop\\n-ments, but is suffering some delays resulting from pandemic-related financial and operational hur\\n-dles. Nonetheless, the start-up of the Area 1 field cluster, Ixachi expansion and Hokchi fields, as well \\nas the larger Zama and Trion developments towards the end of the medium-term period, will help to \\nstem and reverse the decline in output seen in recent years. Over the long-term, however, unless new \\nresources can be tapped, Mexican liquids supply is projected to decline to 1.6 mb/d by 2045.\\nNorway\\nNorway™s total liquids supply increased to 2 mb/d in 2020, from 1.7 mb/d in 2019, as production at \\nthe super-giant Johan Sverdrup field continued to increase steadily, and amid a range of other, \\nsmaller field start-ups. Phase 1 of Johan Sverdrup is now expected to reach full capacity of around \\n535 tb/d in the course of 2021, and starting from 2022, a second phase will add another 220 tb/d. \\nDespite a series of pandemic-related delays to projects including Nova (ex-Gjoa), Johan Castberg \\nand Martin Linge, Norwegian production continues to benefit from expected small- to medium-sized \\nfields being tied back to production hubs. From 2023 and 2024, production from Johan Castberg will \\nlikely add another 200 tb/d, pushing the country™s total supply to a new peak of 2.5 mb/d in 2024, \\na level last reached in 2008. Thereafter, underlying decline in the mature base will see Norwegian \\n liquids supply slide again, reaching around 2 mb/d by 2030 and an estimated 1.3 mb/d by 2045. \\nUKCompared to Norway, the UK will see a more modest string of new field start-ups in the medium-\\nterm, and is thus projected to see a decline in liquids supply from 1.1 mb/d in 2020 to 0.9 mb/d in \\n2026. Starting from 2021, new projects include Cragganmore, Vorlich, the Evelyn tieback to the \\nTriton complex, Galapagos and the Penguins redevelopment. \\nLike other countries, the UK suffered numerous delays and the postponement of decisions for \\nfield start-up dates and investment commitments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same \\ntime, if some of the larger fields postponed get the go-ahead, such as the 100 tb/d Rosebank pro\\n-ject, there is also some upside to this outlook.\\nIn March 2021, industry body Oil & Gas UK warned of the impact of underinvestment in the UK™s \\nupstream sector if the government failed to provide more policy certainty. Under pressure to live \\nup to its environmental promises, the government announced a $22 billion plan in March 2021 \\nto decarbonize the North Sea oil and gas sector, likely raising costs and potentially making fur\\n-ther development less attractive. It will also likely evaluate whether the current upstream licens\\n-ing system is in line with its climate commitments. Any significant tightening of restrictions could \\nlead to an even steeper decline than currently projected in the long-term outlook, which sees UK \\nliquids supply edging down to 0.7 mb/d by 2045 (Figure 4.9).\\nBrazil\\nBoth in the medium- and long-term, Brazil remains one of the largest contributors to non-OPEC liq\\n-uids supply growth. As with other producers, it experienced some project delays due to the pandemic, \\nmainly related to workforce restrictions in Asian shipyards involved in the construction of floating pro\\n-duction, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels destined for Brazil™s huge offshore production zones. \\n154\\nNonetheless, due to the extraordinary productivity and attractive economics of its large \\n deepwater fields, no fewer than ten major FPSOs are expected to be launched in the medium-\\nterm, with a net nameplate capacity of 1.8 mb/d. These include the Buzios 5 and 6 projects, \\nwith capacities of 150 tb/d and 220 tb/d, respectively, adding to the already-large overall Buzios \\ncomplex. Additionally, in 2022, the first stage of the major Mero complex is expected to see first \\nproduction, followed by Mero 2 in 2023, Mero 3 in 2024 and Mero 4 in 2025, each with nameplate \\ncapacity of 180 tb/d. \\nA new milestone is also expected in 2024 with the start-up of the 220 tb/d Bacalhau field, the first \\nto be run by an IOC Œ in this case Equinor, the operator, and with other stakes held by ExxonMobil, \\nPetrogal and the Brazilian government.\\nAs a result, total Brazilian liquids supply is expected to rise from 3.7 mb/d in 2020 to 5 mb/d in \\n2026, largely driven by new output from its ultra-deepwater pre-salt sector. Thereafter, assum\\n-ing continued investment in its prolific resource base, production is set to rise to a slightly higher \\n 5.3 mb/d, albeit gradually, and plateau at this level in the long-term (Figure 4.10). \\nGuyana\\nFollowing initial oil production from the Liza complex in late 2019, Guyana produced an average \\n 70 tb/d in 2020. With the expected start-up of Liza Phase 2 in 2022 and Liza Phase 3 in 2024, FPSOs \\nwith nameplate capacity of 220 tb/d and 180 tb/d, respectively, and further additions thereafter, \\nmedium-term production should rise to just over 0.7 mb/d by 2026.

Similar warnings are regularly heard when the govern\\n-ment adjusts or announces tweaks to other specific tax breaks, including for offshore, heavy or \\nother types of crude oil. At the same time, the government continues to, in effect, experiment with \\nthe recently-introduced excess profit tax, having expanded trials to a far wider set of fields. \\nThe government acknowledged Œ in a draft report released in early 2021 Œ the challenges the \\nRussian oil sector faces in the light of a weaker post-pandemic global demand outlook, and \\nmounting pressure for potential climate-related policy changes.\\nAgain, taxation levels and implementation remain key to developing more expensive, technically \\nchallenging or remote reserves, including offshore Œ especially the Arctic Œ and in Eastern Siberia. \\nThis Outlook assumes that while western sanctions remain in place, development of offshore \\nArctic oil, in particular, will likely remain prohibitively expensive. \\nNonetheless, Rosneft is increasingly likely to go ahead with its ambitious Vostok Oil mega-\\nproject, which would help to sustain, or potentially even grow, long-term output. In reality this \\nis a collection of existing assets already under production, including the Vankor, Suzun and \\nTagul fields, among others, and would also include new fields such as the Payakha complex, as \\nwell as the Zapadno-Irkinskoye field, and other so-far largely unexplored assets. Located in the \\nKrasnoyarsk region in Eastern Siberia, close to Russia™s northern Arctic coast, the oil would be \\ngathered and exported from a new terminal on the Taimyr peninsula and shipped to markets via \\nthe new Northern Sea Route. Given the existing infrastructure around the large Vankor com\\n-plex, it would be used as a hub from which a new pipeline would be built to the export terminal \\non the coast. \\nThe Vostok mega-project has so far attracted significant MET and other tax breaks. Moreover, \\nlarge commodity traders Trafigura and Vitol bought stakes of 10% and 5%, respectively, in late \\n2020 and mid-2021, while many contracts for related infrastructure have been signed. According \\nto statements, Rosneft hopes to be able to export as much as 600 tb/d of Vostok-related crude \\noil from 2024, with later phases of the entire project seeing production potentially rising to \\n 1Œ2 mb/d. However, it remains somewhat unclear how much of this would rely upon existing pro\\n-duction assets and, given the huge size of the project, there may be delays. \\nKazakhstanKazakhstan is projected to be a major driver of future non-OPEC liquids supply with output rising \\nfrom 1.8 mb/d in 2020 to 2.2 mb/d in 2026, with production at existing assets increasing. \\nThe Kashagan gas re-injection project should add around 100 tb/d by 2025, and the Future Growth \\nProject at the super-giant Tengiz field should come online from 2024, adding 260 tb/d. In late \\nDecember 2020, the Karachaganak condensate field got the go-ahead for some smaller incre\\n-mental production, helping to keep production at the field flat until the 2030s. Beyond the medium-\\nterm, further, modest expansion at existing fields is projected to result in total liquids supply \\n rising to 2.5 mb/d in the 2030s and then plateauing at that level (Figure 4.12). \\nUganda, Kenya and Senegal\\nIn Uganda, the long-awaited final investment decision to proceed with the construction of a \\n strategic pipeline was made in April 2021, which will enable the development of the 230 tb/d Lake \\nAlbert complex of fields. The pipeline will be the longest heated pipeline in the world, stretching \\nsome 1,500 km from Hoima near Lake Albert in Uganda, to Tanga on the Tanzanian coast. Joint-\\nventure partners TotalEnergies and China™s CNOOC will then develop the 190 tb/d Tilenga and \\n 157\\n40 tb/d Kingfisher fields to feed the pipeline, as well as a 60 tb/d refinery to be built in Hoima. The \\nfirst oil is expected from around mid-decade (Figure 4.13).\\nIn further regional developments, the go-ahead in Uganda may sway Kenya towards \\n developing similarly landlocked fields in the South Lokichar Basin. Meanwhile, in West Africa, \\nSenegal is expected to see the first oil from the Sangomar Phase 1 project from around 2024, \\n ultimately adding 100 tb/d with the potential to be developed in further phases. \\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.12\\nKazakhstan total liquids supply outlook\\nFigure 4.12\\nmboe/d204500.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82.02.22.42.62.820192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045mb/dCrudeNGLs and other liquidsFigure 4.13\\nAfrica total liquids supply outlook\\n* Africa other includes Cameroon, Senegal, Tunisia, Uganda and smaller producers, but excludes African OPEC producers.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.13\\nmboe/d00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82.02015202020252030203520402045mb/dChadEgyptSouth AfricaSudan/South SudanGhanaAfrica other*158\\n4.4 Liquids supply by type\\nAs observed in previous publications, crude oil supply growth is the main medium-term driver, \\nmaking up 4.9 mb/d, or two-thirds of total non-OPEC supply growth of 7.5 mb/d to 2026.

Canada, Russia and Argentina are forecast to see output rise to a respectable 0.3Œ0.5 mb/d \\nin the long-term, with most of the increment provided by Russia.

This pattern should be repeated in 2021, albeit less pronounced, \\nbut from 2022, US tight oil is expected to grow again. Thus, total US tight liquids is forecast to rise \\nfrom 11.5 mb/d in 2020 to 14.8 mb/d by 2026, or by 3.3 mb/d (Figure 4.14). This is around 40% of \\ntotal non-OPEC growth in this period. \\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.14\\nUS tight liquids supply outlook breakdown\\nFigure 4.14\\nmboe/d204502468101214162015202020252030203520402045mb/dPermianBakkenEagle FordNiobraraOtherUnconventional NGLsThis growth trajectory represents a modest downward revision from the outlook presented in the \\nWOO 2020. In late 2020, and so far in 2021, investors and tight oil producers have appeared cau\\n-tious, with much talk of capital discipline, and attempts to avoid overproduction and a resulting \\nboom and bust cycle. Moreover, besides the mighty Permian, most of the key producing basins \\nare expected to soon reach their peak, as crucial ‚Tier 1™ acreage and drilling opportunities have \\nlargely been used up.\\nNonetheless, for a number of reasons, US tight oil is expected to see a strong recovery in the lat\\n-ter part of the medium-term period. Assuming a continued supportive market environment, con\\n-ditions are expected to gradually incentivize producers to boost output. Essentially this is also \\nvisible in forward-looking short-term indicators, including a rise in rig counts, increased drilling \\nand fracking activity, a return to more upstream investment (albeit so far cautious), and increased \\nmergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. Key oilfield services provider Halliburton in July 2021 \\nflagged what it saw as a bright outlook for upstream activity in North America (and internation\\n-ally) in 2H21 and into 2022, speaking of double-digit growth in drilling and completion spending in \\nthe US shale patch.\\nMost importantly, at current and expected price levels, developing new tight oil production capac\\n-ity remains eminently profitable. Recently, there has been an increased focus on generating free \\ncash flow and returning funds to investors Œ in contrast to the initial years of the US shale boom \\nwhen many companies redirected nearly all their revenue towards expanding production. The \\nkey point now is that with global demand expected to recover and grow further, at some point \\nmarket conditions are expected to incentivize and enable tight oil producers to do both: increase \\n production again, while returning money to shareholders.\\n161\\nThis is evident in break-even prices which, according to Rystad Energy, averaged at the well-head, \\nand depending on the basin, in a range of $20Œ$35/b (and falling) in 2021 (Figure 4.15). Even taking \\ninto account returns to investors and a degree of caution, especially among publicly-traded opera\\n-tors, prices consistently above $50Œ$60/b or more should allow for reinvestment beyond the level \\nrequired to keep production steady.\\nWhile much has been made of curbs to capital access, and some investors moving away from what \\nhas historically not been the best investment, private operators (as opposed to public ones) have \\ntaken the lead in hiking drilling activity, suggesting that once freed of (some of) the financial pres\\n-sure, public companies may follow suit. Indeed, US E&Ps active in the US shale sector have been \\nvocal about their appreciation of the actions of the DoC in terms of stabilizing markets, and not shy \\nto highlight their renewed vigilance and conservatism in terms of curbing investment and growth. \\nTherefore, the implication is that once market fundamentals have ‚rebalanced™, by which these \\ncompanies seem to mean not just demand and supply becoming re-aligned, but also stocks and \\nOPEC spare capacity having been drawn down, they will likely return to growth mode. \\nThus, annual growth in total US tight liquids supply is expected to pick up again sharply in 2022 \\nand 2023, growing at 0.7 mb/d and 1 mb/d, respectively, to some extent making up for the ground \\nlost during the pandemic. It should also be noted that expansion at these levels is far from the \\nrecord-high levels of 2 mb/d seen in 2018, or 1.7 mb/d in 2019, before COVID-19 struck. \\nIn the latter years of the medium-term, annual growth is set to average 0.5 mb/d, before slowing \\nfurther and peaking around the end of the decade. In 2030, total US tight liquids supply is esti\\n-mated to average just over 15 mb/d, out of total US supply of 20 mb/d. After a long slow plateau\\n-ing, US tight oil is expected to decline again, reaching 13.3 mb/d by 2045, and thus resulting in a \\nconcurrent decline in total US liquids production. \\nAlthough peaking at a lower level than estimated in previous reports, US tight oil remains an \\nimportant medium-term driver of non-OPEC liquids supply growth, averaging around 50% of \\nincremental supply in the 2022Œ2026 period.\\nFigure 4.15\\nEvolution of US tight oil wellhead breakeven prices by basin\\nSource: Rystad Energy, July 2021.\\nFigure 4.15\\nmboe/d01020304050607080BakkenDJ BasinEagle FordPermianDelawarePermianMidland$/b201420152016201720182019202020212022202320242025162\\n4.6 OPEC liquids supply\\nOPEC total liquids supply is projected to recover from its 2020 low, when the DoC production \\nadjustments were initiated due to the pandemic-related demand slump. In 2020, OPEC liquids \\nfell to 30.7 mb/d on average, down from 34.6 mb/d in 2019. But as demand recovers and non-\\nOPEC supply Œ especially US tight oil Œ takes time to get up to speed again, OPEC liquids is set to \\nincrease again quickly in the medium-term, rising to 34 mb/d by 2023, nearly back to pre-pan\\n-demic levels. The level is then set to plateau for several years. \\nIn the longer-term, and especially when non-OPEC liquids supply itself is projected to plateau and \\npeak in the late 2020s (in turn due to US tight oil peaking at that point), OPEC liquids begin to rise \\nagain, increasing from 35.7 mb/d in 2030 to 42.7 mb/d in 2045. In terms of market share, this implies \\na rise from 33% at the nadir in 2020, to 39% in 2045, relative to global liquids supply (Figure 4.16). \\nFigure 4.16\\nOPEC total liquids supply\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.16\\nmboe/d2045272931333537394143454720192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045mb/d4.7 Crude qualityIn recent years, the expansion of US tight oil production has had the biggest impact on global \\ncrude oil quality. Tight oil barrels are mostly light-sweet, with very high API gravity. Some tight oil \\ngrades have API gravity close to or even higher than 55°. \\nThis is the major reason why the global average API gravity of crude and condensate supply increased \\nfrom below 33° in 2016 to 33.7° in 2019. At the same time, sulphur content fell from around 1.3% to \\n1.24% in 2019. Consequently, refinery intake has lightened mostly in the US, but elsewhere too. The \\naverage barrel processed in the US had an average API gravity of just 30.5° in 2013. According to EIA \\ndata, this average increased to around 33° in 2019 and 2020, in line with the rising intake of locally \\nproduced tight oil and lower imports. Some countries in the Asia-Pacific (e.g. India and China) have \\nrecently increased imports of US tight oil barrels, thus increasing the average API gravity (Figure 4.17). \\nThe sudden supply drop in 2020, as already discussed, led to a temporary drop of 0.2° in API grav\\n-ity to 33.5°. Nevertheless, medium- and long-term trends are expected to remain similar to what \\nwas projected in previous WOOs. The expected rise in US tight oil production and further additions \\n163\\nFigure 4.17\\nGlobal crude oil quality*\\n* Includes crude, condensate and synthetic crudes.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.17\\n1.101.151.201.251.301.351.4032.032.533.033.534.034.535.0%API° gravityAPI° gravitySulphur content (RHS)mboe/d201720192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045of light-sweet barrels elsewhere (e.g. Kazakhstan) are likely to lead to a recovery of the API \\n gravity in the global average barrel, reaching around 33.7° in 2024. \\nAfter 2024, the global API gravity is likely to remain stable until 2030. This is the result of several \\nforces. US tight oil production is expected to peak in the late 2020s, while light production will \\ncontinue increasing in Kazakhstan. Additions of heavier crude production in the Middle East will \\nbe offset by losses of heavy production in Latin America (e.g. Colombia and Mexico). Some large \\nadditions in this period (e.g. Guyana) include mostly medium grades close to the global average. \\nBeyond 2030, the global API gravity average is expected to decline gradually to levels around 33.2° \\nin 2045. This is in line with a rising share of heavier barrels from the Middle East, Canada and, to \\nsome extent, Latin America, and by declining light production in the US, Europe and Asia. \\nAt the same time, the sulphur content of an average crude barrel is expected to drop from around \\n1.24% in 2020 to just above 1.2% in 2026, in line with additions of sweet grades, mostly from the \\nUS, Latin America and Kazakhstan. In the long-term, rising production in regions such as the \\nMiddle East and Canada increase the global sulphur average to 1.36% in 2045, which is higher \\nrelative to levels seen in previous years. Rising sulphur content, in combination with stricter envi\\n-ronmental regulation, is likely to result in increasing requirements for refining desulphurization \\ncapacities (see Chapter 5). \\n4.8 Upstream investment requirements \\nIn order to meet the demand needs as set out in this Outlook™s Reference Case, the required \\ninvestment in the global upstream sector is estimated to average around $370 billion p.a. in the \\n2021Œ2045 timeframe (in 2021 US dollars). From around $350 billion in 2021, investment needs \\nare expected to rise to a peak of just under $400 billion around 2030, in line with the projected \\nrecovery and growth in non-OPEC liquids supply, in particular, for US tight oil in this period \\n(Figure 4.18). \\n164\\nFigure 4.18\\nAnnual upstream investment requirements for capacity additions, 2021Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.18\\nmboe/d0501001502002503003504004502021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045$ (2021) billionRest of the WorldOPECNorth AmericaAdding in the investment needs in Canada™s upstream, including from the country™s relatively \\n capital-intensive oil sands industry, as well as spending required in Mexico, North America™s total \\nupstream investment requirements make up approximately two-thirds of global medium-term \\ninvestment needs. Parallel with tight oil™s peak and decline from around 2030, North America™s \\nshare is reduced in the long-term, falling below 50% of global spending from the mid-2030s, and \\nshrinking further to just over 40% in 2045. At the same time, annual investment needs are reduced \\nin the long-term. \\nThe relative share of both OPEC and the rest of the world rise over the long-term, with the \\n former™s investment requirements increasing from around a 10% share in 2021 to nearly 20% by \\n2045, as OPEC™s market share is set to increase from 33% to 39% over the time horizon of this \\nOutlook. The relative share of the rest of the world™s upstream investment requirements, mean\\n-while, rises from 25% to 40% in this period. In sum, over 25 years, cumulative upstream invest\\n-ment requirements are estimated to be $9.2 trillion. \\nIn the downstream sector, total required investments are estimated at $1.5 trillion in the 2021Œ\\n2045 period. These include investments of nearly $450 billion in new refinery projects and expan\\n-sions of existing units located mostly in developing countries, including those in the Middle \\nEast, Asia-Pacific, Africa and Latin America. Furthermore, required investments for continuous \\nmaintenance and replacement are estimated at around $1 trillion, spread across all regions. \\nRequired investments in the midstream sector are estimated at around $1.1 billion in the same \\ntime horizon and are attributed to the expansion of the infrastructure for refining, storage and \\npipeline systems, predominantly in developing regions, but also in large oil exporting regions (e.g. \\nthe US & Canada and the Russia & Caspian). Thus globally, oil-related investment needs in the \\nlong-term are estimated at $11.8 trillion (Figure 4.19).\\n165\\nFigure 4.19\\nCumulative oil-related investment requirements by sector, 2021Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 4.19\\nUpstreamDownstreamMidstreammboe/d9.21.51.1$(2021) trillion166\\nRefining outlook\\n167\\nKey takeaways\\nŁ Last year™s oil demand shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic saw in increased \\n pressure on the global downstream sector, which has experienced numerous refinery \\nclosures and is set to see additional closures in the coming years. \\nŁ In the medium-term (2021Œ2026), around 6.9 mb/d of new refining capacity is projected \\nto come online, mostly in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific and Africa.

However, projected closures should help to offset this \\n imbalance by 2026. \\nŁ Global refinery utilization rates are forecast at 81% in 2024 and slightly lower by 2026, \\nwhich is still higher relative to 2019 levels. This is in line with recovering demand, but \\nalso due to the realization of numerous closures triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nŁ In the long-term, utilization rates are set to decline to just above 76% in 2045 as more \\ncapacity comes online and demand declines in developed regions. Utilization rates in the \\nUS & Canada, Europe and developed Asia-Pacific regions will be affected the most. This \\nwill call for further closures if rates are to be kept at sustainable levels. \\nŁ The COVID-19 pandemic and related demand shock accelerated the rationalization wave \\nin the global downstream sector. The Reference Case estimates closures of 4.5 mb/d \\nbetween 2020 and 2026, mostly in the US & Canada (1.1 mb/d), Europe (1.4 mb/d) and the \\nAsia-Pacific (1.8 mb/d). \\nŁ On the secondary capacity side, projections indicate the need to add some 7.1 mb/d of \\nconversion units, 16.7 mb/d of desulphurization capacity and 4.7 mb/d of octane units in \\nthe period from 2021Œ2045, alongside 14 mb/d of new distillation capacity.\\nŁ Total downstream investments are estimated at around $1.5 trillion in the period \\n2021Œ2045.

It is fully consistent \\nwith OPEC Reference Case projections on oil supply (Chapter 4) and demand (Chapter 3). It exam\\n-ines how different factors could impact the global refining sector in the future. The analysis is con\\n-ducted in two timeframes Œ the medium-term (2021Œ2026) and long-term (2021Œ2045).\\nIt first highlights recent developments in the downstream sector during 2020 and 2021. This is fol\\n-lowed by an updated assessment of current ‚base™ capacity by region (as of January 2021), which \\nserves as the basis for medium- and long-term projections. Furthermore, new refining capacity \\nprojections in the medium- and long-term by region and globally are covered.\\nThe analysis in this chapter shows how the downstream market balance changes in the medium-\\nterm at the global and regional levels, based on the projected refining capacity additions and the \\noil demand outlook. The so-called ‚call-on-refining™ is compared to potential refining capacity, \\nglobally and regionally. As a result, significant differences between regions become evident, with \\ndifferent implications for the downstream sector. In the long-term, based on the modelling cases, \\nglobal and regional refinery throughputs and utilization rates are projected.\\nRecent and future refinery closures are also analyzed. In the medium-term, projections are based \\non announcements (firm closures) and the assessment of potential closures by 2026. Based on \\nthe projected regional utilization rates (including the assumptions on refinery closures in the \\nmedium-term), the analysis gives an indication of the level of necessary long-term closures to \\nkeep utilization rates at sustainable levels.\\nSecondary capacity additions are also examined in detail with projections for conversion and \\ndesulphurization capacity, as well as octane units, in the medium- and long-term. The poten\\n-tial consequences of capacity additions on the market balance in the medium-term are also \\nhighlighted.\\nBased on projected refinery additions (primary and secondary), the necessary investment require\\n-ments are calculated. Finally, this chapter looks at the key uncertainties to this Outlook and \\n highlights the major challenges to the downstream sector in the years to come.\\n5.1 Existing refinery capacity\\n5.1.1 Recent developments in the downstream sector\\nAs already highlighted in the WOO 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on the global \\nrefining system. Severe declines in oil demand led to lower utilization rates, as well as decreasing \\nrefinery margins in all major refining hubs. Refinery downtime, including planned and unplanned \\nmaintenance, surged temporarily to more than 22 mb/d in mid-2020 and utilization rates dropped \\nbelow 70% in many major refining regions (Figure 5.1) \\nThe recovery started in mid-2020 and was largely underway by 2H20. It followed different \\n pathways depending on local lockdown policies and related oil demand levels. Chinese utiliza\\n-tion rates recovered rapidly and had already increased to levels close to 90% in May 2020. They \\nremained strong throughout 2020 and in early 2021, in line with recovering demand in the country. \\nThis was even more impressive when considering that China actually added new refining capacity \\nand its refinery throughputs reached all-time high levels, surpassing 14 mb/d in 2H20. This was \\nconsiderably higher compared to 2019 average levels of around 13 mb/d\\nRefinery utilization rates in other regions recovered during 2H20, but remained lower relative to \\npre-pandemic levels. This trend continued in 1H21 with utilization rates in most of the regions still \\nbelow pre-pandemic levels, due to lockdown measures brought on by second and third pandemic \\n169\\nFigure 5.1\\nRefinery utilization rates in selected regions\\nSource: OPEC.\\nwaves. However, during the summer of 2021, the relaxation of measures in several regions, \\nincluding the US and most of the EU, helped to lift refinery throughputs considerably. For instance, \\nUS refinery utilization in June and July 2021 came close to levels seen in the respective months \\nof 2019. Furthermore, the 2020 demand shock triggered a downstream rationalization wave with numer\\n-ous announcements for closures or longer shutdowns. The refining sector was exhibiting over\\n-capacity even in 2019 and a rationalization phase seemed unavoidable even before the outbreak \\nof COVID-19. The pandemic, however, seems to have accelerated this streamlining significantly \\nwith around 4.5 mb/d of capacity closures expected for the period 2020Œ2026, mostly in devel\\n-oped regions. This development will certainly help to stabilize utilization rates at more sustain\\n-able levels.\\nRefinery closures were also partly due to lacklustre prospects for oil demand in developed regions \\nas many countries have been pushing for a faster substitution of oil in an effort to reduce emis\\n-sions. Accordingly, many oil and gas companies reacted to this policy shift and announced divest\\n-ments in their oil portfolios, including downstream. \\nNevertheless, the above-mentioned rationalizations are still lower relative to refinery capacity \\nnew builds in the period to 2026. Many projects are in construction or will reach a FID soon, mostly \\nin developing regions with considerable oil demand growth prospects. \\n5.1.2 Base refinery capacity in 2021\\nThis section provides a detailed update on base capacity assessments Œ distillation and secondary \\ncapacity, including condensate splitters Œ of refineries worldwide. It includes additions to existing \\nrefineries, new refineries that have come on stream, as well as closures that occurred during 2020.\\nThe OPEC Secretariat™s approach is that refineries, unless officially closed, are included in the \\ndatabase of so-called ‚nameplate™ capacity, although their effective capacity may be identified as \\nFigure 5.1\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n020406080100120%OECD AmericasOECD Asia-PacificRussiaOECD EuropeMiddle EastChinaIndiaJan 18Mar 18May 18Jul 18Sep 18Nov 18Jan 19Mar 19May-19Jul 19Sep 19Nov 19Jan 20Mar 20May 20Jul 20Sep 20Nov 20Jan 21Mar 21May 21170\\nbeing well below the nameplate level, where appropriate. Overall, it should be stated that no sin\\n-gle data source for global and regional refinery capacities can be relied upon entirely. The quality \\nand availability of capacity reporting varies by refinery, so there is always an element of determin\\n-ing a ‚best estimate™ for base capacity, primary and secondary alike, as well as for new projects \\nand closures.\\nTable 5.1 provides details by region and process on the 101.9 mb/d of assessed base refinery \\ncapacity (distillation) as of January 2021. This level represents a net reduction \\nversus\\n the 102.6 mb/d listed in the WOO 2020 for January 2020. As such, it constitutes an exception to the almost \\nconstant trend of global capacity increases y-o-y. It should be noted that the assessed 102.6 mb/d \\nfor January 2020 included the 400 tb/d from Saudi Aramco™s Jizan refinery. This refinery was phys\\n-ically completed in late 2019, but commercial operations at the facility did not start until spring \\n2021. Removing that project, now set for a 2021 start-up, adjusts the January 2020 capacity, as \\nshown in the WOO 2020, down to 102.2 mb/d. \\nTable 5.1\\nAssessed available base capacity as of January 2021\\nUS &CanadaLatinAmerica\\nAfrica\\nEurope\\nRussia & \\nCaspianMiddle\\nEast\\nChinaOtherAsia-Pacific\\nWorld\\nDistillation\\nCrude oil (atmospheric)\\n20.2 \\n7.7 \\n3.9 \\n15.7 \\n7.6 \\n9.9 \\n17.4 \\n19.5 \\n101.9 \\nVacuum\\n9.1 \\n3.4 \\n0.9 \\n6.7 \\n3.1 \\n2.8 \\n7.0 \\n6.1 \\n39.2 \\nUpgrading\\nCoking\\n2.9 \\n0.8 \\n0.1 \\n0.8 \\n0.5 \\n0.4 \\n2.2 \\n1.1 \\n8.8 \\nCatalytic cracking\\n5.8 \\n1.6 \\n0.2 \\n2.3 \\n0.9 \\n1.0 \\n4.0 \\n3.7 \\n19.6 \\nHydro cracking\\n2.5 \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n2.3 \\n0.8 \\n0.9 \\n2.3 \\n1.7 \\n10.9 \\nVisbreaking\\n0.1 \\n0.4 \\n0.2 \\n1.5 \\n0.7 \\n0.6 \\n0.2 \\n0.6 \\n4.1 \\nSolvent deasphalting\\n0.4 \\n0.1 \\n0.0 \\n0.2 \\n0.0 \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n0.2 \\n1.2 \\nGasoline\\nReforming\\n3.8 \\n0.6 \\n0.5 \\n2.4 \\n0.8 \\n1.2 \\n2.1 \\n3.0 \\n14.5 \\nIsomerization\\n0.8 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.6 \\n0.3 \\n0.5 \\n0.2 \\n0.4 \\n3.0 \\nAlkylation\\n1.3 \\n0.2 \\n0.0 \\n0.2 \\n0.1 \\n0.1 \\n0.2 \\n0.4 \\n2.5 \\nPolymerization\\n0.1 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.1 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.1 \\nMTBE/ETBE\\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.1 \\n0.0 \\n0.0 \\n0.3 \\n0.1 \\n0.6 \\nDesulphurization\\nNaphtha\\n4.7 \\n0.8 \\n0.6 \\n3.1 \\n1.0 \\n2.0 \\n2.3 \\n3.3 \\n17.6 \\nGasoline\\n2.9 \\n0.5 \\n0.1 \\n0.7 \\n0.3 \\n0.4 \\n1.5 \\n1.4 \\n7.7 \\nMiddle distillates\\n6.6 \\n2.4 \\n0.8 \\n5.9 \\n2.4 \\n2.8 \\n4.5 \\n7.0 \\n32.4 \\nHeavy oil/Residual fuel\\n3.2 \\n0.4 \\n0.0 \\n1.8 \\n0.3 \\n0.7 \\n1.1 \\n3.1 \\n10.7 \\nSulphur (short tons/day)\\n42,616 \\n7,242 \\n3,889 \\n20,211 \\n7,818 \\n13,018 \\n18,923 \\n33,048 \\n146,765 \\nHydrogen (million scf/d)\\n6,423 \\n1,221 \\n397 \\n5,001 \\n2,033 \\n3,157 \\n6,676 \\n6,422 \\n31,331 \\nSource: OPEC.\\nmb/d\\n171\\nThe main contributor to the reduction in January 2021 base capacity, compared to the previous \\nyear, was the very high level of refinery closures that occurred during 2020. These were precipi\\n-tated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting historic drop in global liquids demand. Nearly \\n1.5 mb/d of refinery closures occurred in 2020 (see section 5.2.4), which was far above the aver\\n-age of around 0.6 mb/d of annual closures that had occurred in the preceding five years. It also \\nexceeded the 1.2 mb/d of new capacity that came online in 2020. Together, with minor adjustments \\nto the base capacities of individual refineries, these factors led to a net assessed capacity of 101.9 \\nmb/d at the start of 2021.\\nAt the regional level, the US and Europe in 2020 lost over 0.5 and 0.4 mb/d of distillation capacity, \\nrespectively, whereas China, Other Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and, to a smaller extent, Africa, \\nwere the regions where capacities increased. It is worth noting that the capacity increases evi\\n-dent in China during 2020 were achieved despite a set of closures of a number of smaller ‚tea pot™ \\nrefineries.\\nThese changes reflect the continuation of a trend that has been evident for several years, namely \\nthe capacity shift from West to East. In the five years since January 2016, refinery distillation \\ncapacity has remained flat in the US & Canada at just over 20 mb/d, resulting in a small decline \\nin its associated percentage of global capacity, from 20.5% in 2016 to under 20% in 2021. This \\nabsence of refinery growth has been despite large increases in domestic crude and condensate \\nproduction, and represents the effect of limited expansions being offset by limited closures. In \\nthe same period, capacity in Europe has declined by 1.4 mb/d, with its global share dropping from \\n17.5% to 15.4%, mainly through ongoing rationalization that has more than offset limited addi\\n-tions. Conversely, capacity in the Russia & Caspian region has risen by 1 mb/d. Latin America and \\nAfrica have each registered small capacity declines over the same period. \\nIn contrast, over the past five years, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific combined have added \\nover 5 mb/d of new capacity to total almost 47 mb/d in January 2021. This equates to 46% of the \\nglobal total today, up from 43% (41.7 mb/d) in 2016. Moreover, this shift in capacity has occurred \\ndespite Œ and net of Œ some 1.4 mb/d of closures over the period in Other Asia-Pacific, primarily \\nJapan and Australia. In short, beneath a relatively stable global picture lie significant regional dif\\n-ferences in refinery capacity trends.\\nSecondary capacity\\nToday™s refineries are increasingly complex with expanding secondary processing capacity per \\nbarrel of primary distillation capacity. This global trend is the result of a combination of the \\ntendency to close older, simpler refineries; progressively add secondary processing at exist\\n-ing plants; and, generally, build new refineries at a high level of complexity from the outset. In \\nthe latter instance, the new refineries are increasingly designed to yield high outputs of petro\\n-chemical feedstocks. \\nThe underlying drivers of these trends are the long-term shift towards incremental demand \\n predominantly for light clean products, including petrochemicals, an associated steady decline in \\ndemand for residual fuel oil and increasingly stringent fuel quality regulations. Together, these \\ncall for higher levels of upgrading, desulphurization, octane and related supporting capacities, \\nincluding hydrogen and sulphur recovery. Global vacuum distillation capacity currently stands at \\nan average 38.4% of crude (atmospheric) distillation capacity, upgrading at 43.8%, gasoline octane \\nunits at 20.3% and desulphurization at 67.2%. A review of data from previous years confirms these \\nratios reflect a steady increase over time. \\nFigure 5.2 summarizes the data from Table 5.1 as percentages of crude distillation capacity. The \\ntable highlights the variations in refinery complexity between regions. The US & Canada con\\n-tinue to hold the highest levels of upgrading, gasoline production and desulphurization relative \\n172\\nFigure 5.2\\nSecondary capacity relative to distillation capacity, January 2021\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.2\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nUS & CanadaLatin AmericaAfricaEuropeRussia & CaspianMiddle EastChinaOther Asia-PacificGlobal0102030405060708090100UpgradingGasolineDesulphurization%to distillation, reflecting a traditionally very complex refining system. However, continued state-\\nof-the-art refinery capacity additions, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, are raising overall \\nsecondary capacity there relative to distillation, coming closer to the US & Canada levels.\\nFor upgrading capacity, the US & Canada has the highest ratio, at greater than 58% of distilla\\n-tion capacity, followed by China at 51% and Europe at 45%. All other regions show values in the \\n30Œ40% range, apart from Africa at 19%.\\nIn terms of upgrading, the distribution by type of unit varies significantly from region-to-region. \\nThe US & Canada, Latin America and China account for the highest levels of coking, around 25% of \\ntotal upgrading in each region. They also account for two thirds of total global coking capacity. The \\nsame regions, plus Other Asia-Pacific, have the highest proportions of catalytic cracking at around \\n50%. All regions other than Latin America show significant proportions (21Œ33%) of hydrocrack\\n-ing in total upgrading. The distribution of mild upgrading, notably visbreaking, varies widely with \\n significant proportions only in Africa, Europe, Russia & Caspian and the Middle East.\\nFor gasoline units, the US & Canada is an outlier at over 29% of distillation capacity in line with the \\nregion™s exceptionally high gasoline consumption. Europe is at around 22%, illustrating the pres\\n-ence of installed gasoline capacity before the continent™s dieselization shift that led to a gasoline \\nsurplus. At 19Œ20%, levels in the Middle East and Other Asia-Pacific are close to those in Europe, \\nwhile the remaining regions ˜ Latin America, Africa, Russian & Caspian and China ˜ exhibit lower \\nproportions of gasoline units, in the range of 13Œ16%.\\nDesulphurization levels vary widely across regions depending on their fuel standards and crude \\nslates. The highest share of desulphurization is seen in the US & Canada at 86%, which is more \\nthan double that of the lowest region, Africa, at 39%. Refineries in the US & Canada have tradi\\n-tionally processed a large proportion of heavy and medium-sour crudes, mainly imported from \\nother regions, such as Latin America and the Middle East. However, the upswing in light-sweet \\ntight oil production in recent years and declines in heavy crude production in some regions have \\nled the share of heavier crudes in the slate to decline significantly despite the increase in heavy \\n173\\nCanadian output. Related capacity, notably coking and desulphurization, nonetheless, remains \\nin place. \\nEurope and Other Asia-Pacific, which includes countries such as Japan, South Korea and others \\nthat possess substantial amounts of residual desulphurization, also have relatively high propor\\n-tions of desulphurization capacity, at 73% and 76%, respectively. The Middle East is approaching \\n59%, while in the remaining regions Œ Latin America, Russia & Caspian and China Œ the level is in \\nthe 53Œ54% range. Africa™s lower level (39%) reflects the fact that the region is in the earlier stages \\nof progressing toward ultra-low sulphur (ULS) standards for gasoline and diesel. \\nIn Europe, as is the case in the US & Canada, the high desulphurization ratio reflects the long-\\nestablished implementation of ULS fuel standards, while in Other Asia-Pacific and the Middle \\nEast, the high and rising levels reflect a strong movement to ULS standards, plus a situation \\nwhere large new refineries are today invariably built for high levels of clean fuel output to ULS \\nstandards. The same trend is under way in China. \\nWith the continuing progressive adoption of the Euro 4/5/6 standards, reinforced by the recent IMO \\nSulphur Rule, which has been met only partially by the use of scrubbers, the trend towards higher \\ndesulphurization levels can be assumed to continue.\\nAs would be expected, the regions with the highest levels of desulphurization relative to crude \\ncapacity also have the highest levels of sulphur recovery and hydrogen capacity.\\n5.2 Distillation capacity outlook\\n5.2.1 Medium-term distillation capacity additions\\nBased on a review of medium-term refining projects, a projected 6.9 mb/d of new refining \\n capacity is expected to come online between 2021 and 2026. This forecast is more optimistic rela\\n-tive to the WOO 2020 in terms of the total volume of new refining capacity and the annual rate of \\nadditions. Demand recovery, especially in developing countries, and progress on many refining \\nprojects are the main drivers behind this more optimistic outlook. Furthermore, some additions, \\ninitially scheduled for 2020, were shifted to later years, and are reflected in this forecast. Finally, \\nthe 400 tb/d Jizan refinery in Saudi Arabia, which was physically finished in 2019, but only started \\ncommercial operations in 2021 is thus part of this outlook too.\\nIn contrast, last year™s medium-term outlook saw additions of around 5.2 mb/d in the period 2020Œ\\n2025. The outlook reflected medium-term oil market uncertainties, leading to conservative estimates \\nrelated to refinery new builds, especially for projects in the pre-FID phase. This is why the WOO 2020 \\npointed out the possibility of delaying and shifting some refining projects to the period beyond the \\nmedium-term and showed only minor additions in the second half of the medium-term period. \\nFigure 5.3 shows annual medium-term refining capacity additions in combination with estimated \\nannual investments. This outlook does not include minor capacity additions aimed at debottle\\n-necking existing facilities, so-called ‚creep™ capacity. The average annual addition rate between \\n2021 and 2026 is around 1.15 mb/d, which is in line with the 2017Œ2019 average. In contrast to last \\nyear™s outlook, the rate of additions is expected to remain at levels close to 1 mb/d p.a. or above \\nthroughout the medium-term. This is in line with rising oil demand in developing countries and \\nincreasing optimism related to new refinery projects. \\nThe rate of uncertainty in the downstream sector, however, remains high. Oil demand growth in \\nthe coming years will continue to be the key determinant of the refining sector. Even though oil \\ndemand has recovered considerably from the 2020 shock, further pandemic developments, such \\n174\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.3\\nAnnual distillation capacity additions and total projects investment \\nFigure 5.3\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n010203040506070809000.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.82017201820192020202120222023202420252026$(2021) billionmb/dAnnual additionsCost (RHS)as ongoing restrictions and potentially new lockdown measures may pose further challenges. For \\ninstance, new lockdown measures due to new virus variants were introduced in some countries in \\nJuly 2021, for example, in Australia, Russia, parts of Latin America and Europe. Any new lockdown \\nmeasures, or extension of current ones, could negatively influence oil demand growth and poten\\n-tially refinery capacity additions too.\\nMoreover, delays to some refinery projects due to financing and/or technical issues remain a pos\\n-sibility, as has been witnessed in the past. This is why some of the additions, projected to come \\nonline in the medium-term, could be delayed and only come online beyond 2026. \\nProjections for refinery additions by region in this year™s Reference Case are presented in Table 5.2 \\nand Figure 5.4. Similar to previous outlooks, refinery additions are concentrated in developing regions, \\nsuch as the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa. These regions account for almost 90% of the \\nadditions in the period 2021Œ2026. The medium-term outlook contains several large projects, many \\nof which have petrochemical integration as well. These developments are in line with expected oil \\ndemand growth. Other regions are likely to see only marginal refinery capacity expansions in the same \\nperiod, with relatively small projects in the US and Latin America, mostly the expansion of existing \\nplants. Europe is the only region where no new distillation projects are expected in the medium-term.\\nThe Chinese downstream market will likely witness the commissioning of several large refiner\\n-ies with a strong focus on petrochemicals. These include PetroChina™s Jieyang 400 tb/d plant, \\nShenghong™s 320 tb/d refinery in Lianyungang, as well as the 400 tb/d plant being built by Shandong \\nYulong Petrochemical. The latter project will replace several teapot refineries, which have already \\nbeen, or will be closed. In addition, there are several smaller projects in China that are expected \\nto start operations in the medium-term, including expansions of existing plants. In total, China™s \\nmedium-term refining capacity expansion is forecast to reach 1.4 mb/d. \\nOther Asian countries are also expected to boost their capacities in the medium-term (1.8 mb/d) \\nin line with growing demand. In India, there are several ongoing projects, including expansions of \\nexisting facilities. All major refiners in India are involved in capacity expansion, with an increasing \\n175\\nTable 5.2\\nDistillation capacity additions from existing projects by region, 2021Œ2026\\nmb/d\\nUS &CanadaLatinAmerica\\nAfrica\\nEurope\\nRussia &\\nCaspianMiddle\\nEast\\nChinaOther AsiaPacific\\nWorld\\n20210.00.00.00.00.01.00.10.11.220220.00.00.60.00.00.30.40.21.620230.20.00.10.00.00.20.30.10.920240.10.10.10.00.00.10.20.30.920250.10.10.20.00.00.10.30.61.320260.00.10.20.00.00.00.10.61.02021Œ20260.30.31.20.00.11.71.41.86.9%4.9%4.3%17.4%0.7%1.4%25.0%19.7%26.7%100.0%Source: OPEC.\\nfocus on the petrochemical sector. Elsewhere, there are several important projects in other \\n countries of the region. These include plants in Indonesia, led by Pertamina, but also with for\\n-eign participation. Malaysia, Brunei, Laos, Thailand and Pakistan are some of the countries that \\nare expected to witness medium-term refining capacity expansions. However, several of these \\n projects are small and have capacities below 50 tb/d. \\nThe Middle East is another region where significant medium-term refining expansions are \\nexpected, totalling 1.7 mb/d. More than half of the total is accounted for by two projects, starting \\nin 2021. Besides the already noted 400 tb/d Jizan refinery in Saudi Arabia, another large project \\nthat is expected to be commissioned in 2021 is Kuwait™s 615 tb/d Al-Zour refinery.

On top of this, there are several projects in Iraq, IR Iran, \\nBahrain and UAE, which may be commissioned before 2026. \\nAfrica™s medium-term outlook looks more optimistic relative to the WOO 2020, with 1.2 mb/d of \\nnew capacity expected by 2026. Half of this is accounted for by the 650 tb/d Dangote project in \\nNigeria, which is likely to come online in 2022. In addition, there are several smaller projects in \\nWest Africa, mostly located in Nigeria, Angola and Ghana. These projects include a number of \\npre-fabricated modular facilities. Once commissioned, these projects will help to reduce prod\\n-uct imports to Nigeria and West Africa and will, in turn, increase the use of local crude. In North \\nAfrica, refinery capacity expansions are likely in Algeria and Egypt.\\nIn other regions, capacity expansions remain limited. In Latin America, where demand growth \\nwould justify capacity expansion, there is only one large project, the 340 tb/d Dos Bocas refin\\n-ery in Mexico, which is under construction and could materialize in the medium-term. Projects \\nin other countries are limited at the moment partly due to the financial situation of some oil \\ncompanies. In order to reduce its debt and advance market liberalization, Brazil™s Petrobras is \\nseeking to sell eight of its refineries, one of which, the Landulpho Alves Refinery, was recently \\nsold to the UAE™s Mubadala. One project, which was initially considered in this Outlook was the \\n 200 tb/d Limetree Bay refinery in St. Croix. The refinery was commissioned Œ the restart of an \\nolder facility with extensive modifications Œ in early 2021 with the aim to profit from the IMO \\nSulphur Rule, introduced as of 1 January 2020. However, due to financial and technical prob\\n-lems, the refinery was shut down in mid-2021 and is not likely to come back online. \\nIn the US & Canada, medium-term refinery expansions are seen at around 300 tb/d. While no \\nnew projects are expected in Canada, in the US, ExxonMobil™s Beaumont refinery expansion is \\nthe most significant medium-term project. Most of the other projects are smaller expansions of \\nexisting plants. Interestingly, this cumulative expansion will be much smaller relative to esti\\n-mated closures for the medium-term period, which means that total refining capacity in this \\nregion is set to decline.\\nIt is important to highlight that OPEC™s Reference Case with 6.9 mb/d of new capacity additions \\n consists of projects identified from a list of announced projects that total more than 30 mb/d. However, \\nonly some of these projects will materialize in the future. Furthermore, the total medium-term capac\\n-ity additions of 6.9 mb/d are composed of projects in different development stages. Around 3.5 mb/d \\nof capacity is under construction or close to this stage, hence, these are the projects with the highest \\ncertainty to materialize in the medium-term. There are also projects totalling 3.4 mb/d that are mostly \\nin early stages of development, but still advanced enough in terms of financing and engineering to be \\nconsidered ‚firm™ medium-term additions. Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding these projects is \\nhigh with a potential risk that some of the projects only start beyond the medium-term horizon, or get \\ncancelled for various reasons.\\n5.2.2 Long-term distillation capacity additions\\nThis section looks at long-term additions at the global and regional levels, taking into account \\nReference Case assumptions on regional oil demand (Chapter 3) and oil supply (Chapter 4), as well \\nas medium-term refinery capacity additions (Section 5.2.1) and refinery closures (Section 5.2.4). \\nTable 5.3 shows assessed medium-term projects and projected additions beyond the medium-\\nterm based on the long-term downstream sector modelling. \\nAs shown in Table 5.3, on top of the 6.9 mb/d of assessed projects in the medium-term, around \\n 7.1 mb/d of new projects will be needed at the global level between 2027 and 2045. This means \\nthat the medium-term additions are almost equal to required additions in the period 2027Œ2045, \\nin line with the slowdown of oil demand and required refinery throughputs. Consequently, total \\n estimated refinery capacity expansions between 2021 and 2045 amount to 14 mb/d. \\n177\\nTable 5.3\\nRefinery distillation capacity additions by period\\n* Firm projects exclude additions resulting from capacity creep.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nDistillation capacity additions starting 2021\\nAssessed projects*\\nNew units\\nTotal\\nAnnualized2021Œ2025\\n5.9\\n0.2\\n6.2\\n1.0\\n2025Œ2030\\n1.0\\n2.4\\n3.4\\n0.7\\n2030Œ2035\\n0.0\\n2.3\\n2.3\\n0.5\\n2035Œ2040\\n0.0\\n1.6\\n1.6\\n0.3\\n2040Œ2045\\n0.0\\n0.60.60.1\\nCumulative distillation capacity additions\\nAssessed projects*\\nNew units\\nTotal\\nAnnualized2021Œ2025\\n5.9\\n0.2\\n6.2\\n1.0\\n2021Œ2030\\n6.9\\n2.7\\n9.6\\n0.9\\n2021Œ2035\\n6.9\\n4.9\\n11.8\\n0.7\\n2021Œ2040\\n6.9\\n6.5\\n13.4\\n0.62021Œ2045\\n6.9\\n7.114.0\\n0.5\\nFigure 5.5\\nDistillation capacity additions and oil demand growth, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nmb/d\\nFigure 5.5\\nmboe/d2020Œ20252025Œ20302030Œ20352035Œ20402040Œ2045024681012141618mb/dCapacity additions per periodCumulative capacity additionsCumulative oil demand growthFigure 5.5 shows cumulative demand growth between 2019 and 2045 compared with cumulative \\nadditions between 2020 and 2045. Since this analysis operates with cumulative increments related \\nto the base year, 2019 was chosen as the oil demand base year, which helps avoid demand distor\\n-tions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is obvious that the level of refining capacity additions \\n178\\n(15.2 mb/d) is significantly higher compared to the demand growth of 8.3 mb/d. The main reason \\nfor this is the regional distribution of refining additions, which occur mostly in developing coun\\n-tries, where demand still grows in the long-term. For instance, demand growth in the Asia-Pacific \\nis expected to increase (net of declines in OECD Asia) by almost 11 mb/d between 2019 and 2045. \\nIn the same period, oil demand in the Middle East is projected to increase by over 3 mb/d and in \\nAfrica by almost 3.5 mb/d. \\nHowever, in line with the overall oil demand slowdown and the rising share of non-refinery \\n feedstocks (NGLs, CTLs, GTLs and biofuels), the pace of refinery expansion is expected to deceler\\n-ate significantly, from 7.4 mb/d in the period 2020Œ2025 to 3.4 mb/d in the period 2025Œ2030. This \\nrate decreases further and reaches only 0.5 mb/d in the last five years of the outlook. This means \\nthat the period between 2040 and 2045 would possibly see only expansions of existing plants and \\nno new refinery builds.\\nAs a result of global demand development and long-term refinery additions, global refinery \\nutilization rates are set to come under pressure. After the recovery projected for 2025 due to \\nrising oil demand and estimated refinery medium-term closures, refinery utilization rates are \\nexpected to drop from 80.5% to around 76% by 2045. This will probably call for further down\\n-stream sector consolidation, especially in regions where demand declines in the long-term (see \\nSection 5.2.3). \\nRegional additionsSimilar to the medium-term outlook, long-term refinery capacity additions are located in \\n developing regions with growing demand. This is why the majority of long-term refinery additions \\n(14 mb/d) are located in the Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, with almost 95% \\nof the total. Nevertheless, there is a significant slowdown in the rate of additions in the Middle \\nEast and China, while additions in Other Asia-Pacific and Africa are still considerable beyond the \\nmedium-term.\\nIn China, the total expected distillation expansion is around 2.1 mb/d between 2021 and 2045. \\nHowever, as the medium-term outlook for China shows an increase of almost 1.4 mb/d, the \\nexpansion from 2027 onwards is set to be only around 0.7 mb/d. The major reason for this is sub\\n-stantial capacity expansions in recent years and in the medium-term, as well as a demand growth \\nslowdown in the latter outlook period. \\nMiddle East refinery capacity expansions are projected at around 2.8 mb/d between 2019 and \\n2045, with more than 1.7 mb/d already commissioned in the medium-term. Consequently, around \\n1.1 mb/d are expected over the period 2027Œ2045. Recent capacity additions in this region, partly \\nfocused on export markets, in combination with medium-term increments, are sufficient to reach \\nmarket saturation in the long-term. \\nAt the same time, refinery expansions in Other Asia-Pacific are estimated at around 4.3 mb/d by \\n2045, of which 1.8 mb/d is accounted for by medium-term additions. Beyond the medium-term, \\nadditions are expected to remain strong at levels of around 0.7 mb/dŒ0.8 mb/d in the period 2030Œ\\n2035 and 2035Œ2040 as demand still increases at significant rates. There are several large pro\\n-jects in this region, such as in India, Indonesia and Vietnam, which could materialize in the long-\\nterm. In the last five years of the outlook, other Asia-Pacific additions show similar trends to other \\nregions and are expected to drop to around 0.2 mb/d. \\nIn Africa, total long-term refinery expansions are estimated at around 3 mb/d. Between 2021 and \\n2030, 2 mb/d of new refinery capacity is expected, which could help to reduce product imports \\nduring this period. Beyond 2030, capacity additions are likely to see a gradual slowdown, reaching \\nonly 0.1 mb/d in the period 2040Œ2045. \\n179\\nLatin America is also projected to see moderate long-term expansion due to rising oil demand, \\nwhich increases by around 1.3 mb/d between 2019 and 2045. Relatively low additions in the \\nperiod 2021Œ2025 of just 0.2 mb/d will support higher increments of almost 0.35 mb/d in the \\nperiod 2025Œ2030. Post 2030, refining capacities are forecast to increase by around 0.4 mb/d in \\ntotal. \\nUS & Canada, Europe and Russia & Caspian are expected to see only minor expansions beyond \\n2025, some of which can be explained by the continuous need to add capacity for debottleneck\\n-ing purposes and minor projects at existing plants. These regions are expected to see declining \\ndemand and potentially lower product exports, which, in turn, should lead to lower refinery uti\\n-lization rates. Consequently, more refinery closures can be expected, both in the medium- and \\nlong-term. \\nFigure 5.6\\nCrude distillation capacity additions, 2021Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nUS &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia &CaspianMiddleEastChinaOther Asia-Pacific2040Œ20452035Œ20402030Œ20352025Œ20302021Œ2025Figure 5.6\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.55.0mb/d5.2.3 Medium-term balance for the refining sector\\nThis section focuses on the downstream market outlook by taking into consideration capacity \\nadditions, regional oil demand and oil supply. The outlook is divided into two sub-sections Œ the \\nmedium-term and long-term outlook Œ which follow two different methodologies.\\nThe medium-term outlook looks at refinery additions as laid out in Section 5.2.1 and compares \\nthis with the so-called ‚call-on-refining™ (relative to 2019). Even though the current base year is \\n2020, this analysis will refer to the period 2019Œ2026 for oil demand and 2020Œ2026 for refin\\n-ing capacity expansion. This will help eliminate the effect of the large market distortions in 2020, \\nwhich could make medium-term analysis difficult and misleading. \\nThe long-term outlook looks at modelling results to 2045 and projects refinery throughputs and \\nrespective utilization rates at the regional level, including crude and product movements (see \\nChapter 6).\\n180\\nMedium-term global balance\\nAs already shown in Section 5.2.1, medium-term distillation capacity additions at the global level \\nwere assessed at 6.9 mb/d. The assumption (based on the modelling results) is that by 2026 around \\n0.2 mb/d of debottlenecking additions or ‚creep capacity™ will be required, which is added in stages \\nthroughout the medium-term period. The majority of debottlenecking additions are expected in \\nthe US & Canada, due to the large base of existing refineries. \\nThe conservative estimate of ‚capacity creep™ applied here is tightly linked to the detailed project \\nlist that was used for capacity assessments. As a result, total additions, or nameplate capacity, in \\nthe medium-term are estimated at 7.1 mb/d by 2026. If 2020 capacity additions are included, this \\nincreases to around 8.3 mb/d. As per the methodology applied, refinery closures are not taken into \\nconsideration at this stage, but are highlighted later. \\nThe methodology also assumes that new refining capacities may reach the maximum assumed \\nutilization rate of 90%. This assumption provides insight into the potential incremental crude \\nruns on an annual basis between 2020 and 2026. Furthermore, as this outlook is presented on \\nan annual basis, the methodology tries to capture uncertainties related to the start-up of refining \\ncapacity within the year. This is why the calculation takes into account only one-half of the current \\nyear (n) and one half of the previous year (nŒ1).\\n In the following step, the maximum potential incremental crude runs are calculated with \\n incremental refined product demand, or the ‚call-on-refining™. The ‚call-on-refining™ is the result \\nof demand patterns that take into account non-refinery streams such as NGLs, biofuels, CTLs and \\nGTLs (e.g. NGLs used directly in the petrochemical industry), which surpass refinery processing. \\nThis section covers balances from the perspective of distillation capacity, crude runs and total \\ndemand without considering specific refined products.\\nIn the final step, the potential incremental crude runs are compared with the cumulative \\n incremental refined product demand on an annual basis. The analysis is done at the global and \\nregional levels. The resulting balances show the oversupply of refining capacity relative to incre\\n-mental refined product demand and are a good indicator of the state of the downstream sector, \\nglobally and regionally.\\nFinally, it should be noted that the analysis throughout this sub-section also includes assumptions \\non the product stock change throughout the period 2020Œ2026. Given the large imbalance of the \\nmarket in 2020, a large product stock build for 2020 was assumed, with gradual stock draws from \\n2021 onwards. This somewhat alters the picture, \\nversus\\n one based solely on oil demand patterns \\nand changes in non-refinery fuel supply as already described.\\nFigure 5.7 provides a summary assessment of the cumulative medium-term potential for \\n additional crude runs compared to the required incremental product supply from refineries based \\non global product demand growth. As mentioned earlier, this figure includes capacity expansions \\nfor the period 2020Œ2026 and demand growth relative to 2019. Potential refining capacity is set \\nto increase throughout the period, cumulatively reaching almost 5 mb/d by 2023 and 7.8 mb/d by \\n2026. At the same time, the severe drop in the required refining capacity in 2020 due to the plunge in \\ndemand is estimated at around Œ7.5 mb/d in 2020, relative to 2019. The recovery in required refin\\n-ery capacity is projected to be gradual, reaching 2019 levels only in 2023. By 2026, the incremental \\ncall on refining is expected to be around 3.2 mb/d, relative to 2019. \\nThe resulting difference between the potential and required refining capacity in 2020 was almost \\n9 mb/d, which led to a drop in refinery margins and temporary shut-ins in all major refining \\nhubs. However, in line with recovering demand, the gap is likely to decline to around 3.5 mb/d \\n181\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.7\\nAdditional global cumulative refinery crude runs, potential* and required**\\n* Potential: based on expected distillation capacity expansion, assuming no closures.\\n** Required: based on projected demand increases, assuming no change in refined products trade pattern.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.7\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nŒ10Œ8Œ6Œ4Œ202468102020202120222023202420252026mb/dPotential refining capacity based on project listRequired refining capacityin 2023/2024. By 2026, the projected overhang is expected to widen to around 4.6 mb/d. This is \\n considerably higher compared to the WOO 2020, mostly due to a more optimistic medium-term \\noutlook for increasing new build capacity. \\nHowever, this significant capacity overhang will be offset by firm and planned refinery closures \\nover the medium-term, which is projected to reach levels of 4.5 mb/d. In 2023/2024, the level of \\nclosures could be even higher than the projected gap. This is why, if all projected closures mate\\n-rialize, the global refining sector could be more balanced and relatively close to 2019 conditions \\nalready by 2023. The standard caveat applies ˜ the cumulative overhang would be lower if refinery \\nprojects slip and higher should demand growth prove to be less than expected.\\nThe regional picture looks different. The widening gap between potential and required refining \\ncapacity is the result of declining demand in developed regions (the US & Canada and Europe) and \\nof strong refining capacity expansion in the medium-term in developing regions. The downstream \\nmarket outlook for major regions is discussed below.\\nMedium-term regional balances\\nAt the regional level, contrasts in the refining supply/demand balances remain stark. Figures 5.8 \\nto 5.15 present a comparison of data drawn for all major regions in the period 2020Œ2026. \\nFigure 5.8 illustrates the medium-term outlook for the US & Canada. After the strong drop in 2020 \\nof 2.3 mb/d, relative to 2019, and partial recovery in 2021 (Œ1 mb/d relative to 2019), the required \\nrefining capacity is set to switch to positive territory in 2023 and 2024. However, as the region™s oil \\ndemand starts declining towards the end of the medium-term, the required refining capacity is \\nprojected to reach Œ0.1 mb/d in 2026. At the same time, limited refinery expansions, with only one \\nmajor project, will push the potential incremental refining capacity to 0.5 mb/d in 2026. The gap \\nbetween potential and required refining capacity is expected to narrow to just 0.1 mb/d in 2023, in \\nline with the aforementioned recovery, but widen to 0.6 mb/d in 2026.\\n182\\nEurope shows a bleak picture for the refining sector in the medium-term (Figure 5.9). The \\n potential refining capacity in Europe remains virtually zero throughout the medium-term, with only \\nminor creep capacity additions. At the same time, required refining capacity in this region recovers \\nfrom around Œ1.6 mb/d in 2020 to Œ0.7 mb/d in 2023, but drops again to around Œ1.1 mb/d in 2026. \\nThis is in line with the region™s oil demand trajectory, with demand not expected to recover to pre-\\nCOVID levels. Consequently, refinery closures will be necessary to offset negative oil demand trends.\\nIn China, strong growth in both potential and required refinery runs is projected (Figure 5.10). The \\ncall on refining increases to almost 1.7 mb/d by 2026. This, however, includes the rise in refinery \\nruns during 2020, which increased despite negative demand growth across the year.

This was reflected in the downstream market too. \\nPotential refining capacity is also projected to increase strongly, including significant additions \\nduring 2020, reaching levels just above 2 mb/d in 2026. There is a continuous gap between the \\npotential and required refining capacities, amounting to around 0.4 mb/d. However, the caveat to \\nthis outlook is that some of the new additions, for example, the 400 tb/d at the Yulong petrochem\\n-ical complex, are set to replace the closure of several smaller teapot refineries, some of which \\nhave already occurred, or will likely occur in the near future. Taking the closures into account, the \\nmedium-term outlook would be more balanced with minimal gaps between potential and required \\nrefining capacities in 2026.\\nIn the Asia-Pacific (excl. China), the required refinery capacity dropped significantly by 1.9 mb/d \\nduring 2020 (Figure 5.11), in line with the drop in refinery runs. Refinery runs dropped in both \\ndeveloped and developing countries of this region due to the extended lockdown measures. \\nHowever, required refining capacity is projected to recover, reaching positive territory in 2023, and \\nthen climbing further to around 1.2 mb/d in 2026. Meanwhile, significant capacity expansion is \\nexpected in this region, especially in the second part of the medium-term outlook. \\nConsequently, potential refining capacity is likely to rise to around 0.7 mb/d in 2023 and 1.9 mb/d \\nin 2026. Thus, the gap between potential and required refining capacity is expected to narrow from \\nmore than 2 mb/d in 2020 to just 0.3 mb/b in 2024, in line with the forecasted demand recovery. \\nHowever, the significant increase in potential refining capacity towards the end of the medium-\\nterm period results in a widening gap, which is expected to reach 0.8 mb/d. This gap, however, \\ncould be offset by announced closures, mostly in developed countries of this region, such as \\nAustralia, Japan and New Zealand.\\nIn the Middle East (Figure 5.12), potential refining capacity is projected to increase strongly, \\nreaching 1.7 mb/d in 2026. This includes two large projects (Jizan in Saudi Arabia and \\nAl-Zour in Kuwait) and a number of smaller projects. The required refining capacity based \\non demand growth, relative to 2019, in the Middle East increases from Œ0.8 mb/d in 2020 to \\n184\\n0.7 mb/d in 2026. The gap between potential and required refining capacity remains between \\n 0.8 mb/d and 1.3 mb/d throughout the medium-term. This surplus will possibly lead to rising \\n product exports from the Middle East, given that some of the new refineries are state-of-the-\\nart plants with access to locally produced feedstock and with capabilities to compete in the \\n international downstream market.\\nFigure 5.12\\nAdditional cumulative crude runs in the Middle East, potential and required\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.12\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nŒ1.0Œ0.500.51.01.52.02020202120222023202420252026mb/dRequired refining capacityPotential refining capacity based on project listIn the Russia & Caspian (Figure 5.13) region, the magnitude of changes is significantly less \\n compared to other regions.

The potential refining capacity is expected to start increasing in \\n2022 at just below 0.4 mb/d, before reaching just above 1 mb/d in 2026. Required refining capacity \\nis estimated at around Œ0.3 mb/d in 2020, but increases to 0.6 mb/d in 2026. This means that the \\ngap between potential and required refining capacity flips from negative territory in 2020 and 2021, \\n186\\nFigure 5.15\\nAdditional cumulative crude runs in Latin America, potential and required\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.16 shows the cumulative medium-term gap between the incremental potential and \\nrequired refining capacity for all regions. This overhang is estimated at levels of around 8.7 mb/d \\nin 2020 and is due to a combination of falling demand and rising refinery capacity, as previously \\ndiscussed. This gap narrows by 2023/2024 to around 3.5 mb/d, but then widens again and reaches \\n4.6 mb/d by 2026, a level that is significantly higher when compared to last year™s outlook. The \\nmajor reason for this development is declining demand in some regions and significant refin\\n-ing capacity additions at the end of the medium-term, which was not the case in the WOO 2020 \\nReference Case. \\nMany regions are expected to see drops in their overhang as demand recovers, especially in the \\nUS & Canada, Other Asia-Pacific and Europe in 2023 and 2024. However, as demand starts declin\\n-ing in developed regions, the overhang may widen, especially in the US & Canada and Europe. In \\ndeveloping regions, it is due to refining capacity additions towards the end of the outlook period \\nthat the surplus of potential refining capacity increases. \\nIt is important to note that, in the medium-term period, this overhang does not include any \\nassumed closures, which are estimated at around 4.5 mb/d between 2020 and 2026. The major\\n-ity of the closures are expected to occur by 2024, which should help to more than balance out the \\noverhang shown in Figure 5.16.\\nFigure 5.15\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nPotential refining capacity based on project listŒ0.6Œ0.5Œ0.4Œ0.3Œ0.2Œ0.100.10.20.30.42020202120222023202420252026mb/dRequired refining capacityPotential refining capacity based on project listand reaches 0.4 mb/d by 2026.

Cumulative \\nrequired refining capacity is projected to recover from around Œ0.5 mb/d in 2020 to 0.2 mb/d in 2026. \\nThis means that there will be an overhang of refining capacity in the first part of the medium-term, \\nwhich will gradually disappear by 2026 due to rising demand.

This \\n188\\nincludes increased downtime and extended shutdowns for many refineries during 2020, which in \\nsome cases were prolonged to 2021. \\nIn line with the demand recovery during 2021 and 2022, utilization rates are expected to reach \\n levels of 77% and 79%, respectively. In 2023 and 2024, refinery utilization is forecast to increase \\nfurther based on demand growth and additional closures, reaching 81% in 2024. However, based \\non a slowdown in refinery run growth, yet with strong refinery capacity additions, utilization rates \\nare estimated to decline to around 80.5% in 2025 and 2026. Nevertheless, without the assumed \\nclosures from 2021 onwards (see Section 5.2.5), the utilization rate would not climb above 80% in \\nthe medium-term and would only reach levels just above 78% in 2026.\\nFigure 5.18 shows the evolution of oil demand, crude throughputs and distillation capacity at the \\nglobal level (shown by the lines in Figure 5.18). There is the obvious convergence of total oil demand \\nand refining capacity since 1980, which is due to several reasons. The level of refining capacity has \\nhistorically been significantly higher relative to oil demand given the larger share of refined products \\nin total oil demand and, to some extent, due to a significant number of active, but inefficient plants \\nin the downstream sector. However, as the share of non-refinery fuels in total oil demand increased, \\nsuch as NGLs and biofuels, and some inefficient older refinery units were retired, the gap between \\ntotal distillation capacity and oil demand almost disappeared, as can be viewed in recent years, the \\nexception being 2020. This is also illustrated by the refinery run/oil demand ratio. In the early 1980s, \\nthis ratio was above 90% and has consistently declined since, reaching 82% in 2019. \\nFigure 5.18\\nGlobal oil demand, refining capacity and crude runs, 1980Œ2026\\n* Effective ‚spare™ capacity estimate based on assumed 84% utilization rate, accounting for already-closed capacity.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.18\\nmboe/dspare distillation capacity,mb/d demand, distillation capacitycapacity & crude runs,mb/d Spare distillation capacity* (RHS)Effect of actual closuresEffect of assumed closures (RHS)Crude runsOil demandDistillation capacity05101520253001020304050607080901001101201980198519901995200020052010201520202025In the medium-term, global refinery runs will likely reach pre-COVID levels at around 82 mb/d in \\n2023, and will then continue increasing to around 85 mb/d in 2026.

This is \\nsomewhat lower relative to the last year™s outlook, which can be explained by the higher level of \\nassumed medium-term closures.\\n5.2.4 Long-term balance for the refining sector\\nIn this section, the long-term outlook for the downstream market is presented, with a focus on \\nglobal and regional refinery throughputs and utilization in line with demand (Chapter 3) and \\n supply (Chapter 4) projections. \\nTable 5.4 shows refinery throughputs and utilization at the global level and for major regions. \\nRefinery utilization projections include assumptions on refinery closures in the medium-term, but \\ndo not assume any closures beyond 2026. It also includes data for 2019 as an ease of reference \\nfor long-term trends. Global refinery throughputs fell to around 74.5 mb/d in 2020 due to the drop \\nin global demand. The recovery of throughputs is expected to be gradual in the medium-term, \\n reaching 84.7 mb/d in 2025 and above 85 mb/d in 2026. \\n190\\nHowever, in the long-term, refinery throughputs are expected to reach levels of just above 86 mb/d \\nin 2035 and remain stable until 2045 at the global level. This limited increase of throughputs after \\n2025 is in line with the oil demand slowdown and the rising supply of non-refinery fuels, such as bio\\n-fuels, NGLs, CTLs and GTLs. This means that refinery throughputs increase by only around 4 mb/d \\nfrom pre-pandemic levels in 2019 and reach a plateau after 2035. \\nRefinery utilization rates are useful indicators for the state of the refining sector in a given region, \\nas well as globally. At the global level, utilization rates are set to recover by 2025, reaching 80.5%. \\nThis includes significant medium-term refinery closures in the (4.5 mb/d in the period 2020Œ2026). \\nAfter 2025, refinery utilization rates are projected to decline gradually to 76.3%, which could imply \\nthat further refinery closures will be needed in the long-term. \\nAt the regional level, however, there are significant differences. Refinery throughputs in developed \\ncountries are projected to decline strongly as demand starts dropping. This is especially the case \\nin Europe, where refinery throughputs are expected to decline by almost 2 mb/d between 2020 \\nand 2045, never again reaching 2019 levels of around 12.5 mb/d. In the US & Canada, the return \\nof robust demand is expected to boost refinery throughputs to almost 18 mb/d, which is close to \\npre-COVID levels. However, the long-term demand decline will lead to a significant drop in runs, \\nreaching 15.5 mb/d in 2045. This is almost 3 mb/d below 2019 levels. \\nRelative to the demand decline, refinery runs in the US & Canada are forecast to decline less \\ncompared to Europe, due to the local availability of feedstock and highly complex and competi\\n-tive refinery systems that are capable of replacing a part of the local demand losses by increas\\n-ing product exports to other regions, such as the Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, utilization rates \\nin Europe and US & Canada are expected to decline significantly in the long-term, by 15 and \\n 11 pp respectively, between 2019 and 2045. This will probably lead to further refinery closures if \\n utilization rates are to be kept at sustainable levels.\\nRefinery throughputs in the Russia & Caspian are estimated at around 0.6 mb/d between 2020 and \\n2045. This is mostly due to demand declines in export markets, such as Europe, and a demand \\npeak in Russia. Refinery utilization rates are expected to decline to 78.5%, down from strong lev\\n-els of above 90% in 2019. \\nOther regions are anticipated to see significant increases in refinery runs in the long-term, \\nalthough with a significant deceleration towards the end of the outlook period. This development \\nis led by the Middle East, where refinery runs increase to 10.3 mb/d in 2045, up from 6.6 mb/d in \\n2020 (7.4 mb/d in 2019). Utilization rates are expected to increase gradually from around 73% in \\n2019 to almost 81% in 2045. The growth in local demand, as well rising product exports, are the \\nmain reasons for this development. \\nOther Asia-Pacific refineries are also anticipated to see rising runs based on the demand increase \\nand refinery expansion in the long-term. Runs are expected to increase to 19 mb/d in 2040 and \\n2045, up by 2 mb/d from 2019 levels. A large share of this increase is accounted for by India, where \\nstrong demand growth will lead to significant refinery expansions (see Chapter 9). It is important \\nto note that the growth of 2 mb/d between 2019 and 2045 also includes losses in developed coun\\n-tries in the Asia-Pacific region, such as Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Refinery \\nutilization rates in this region are expected to drop from somewhat above 85% levels in 2019 and \\n2025, and reach around 82%Œ83% from 2030 onwards. \\nAt the same time, refinery run increases in China are expected to see a slowdown after 2020. \\nChina managed to increase refinery runs in 2020, relative to 2019, which was based on the coun\\n-try™s strong recovery in 2H20, as well as the start-up of some projects. However, further growth \\nwill be limited due to the expected deceleration of oil demand growth and the rising share of petro\\n-chemical demand. After reaching levels of 13.5 mb/d in 2020, Chinese refinery runs are projected \\n191\\nto climb to 14.8 mb/d in 2035, with marginal declines in the years thereafter. Utilization rates are \\nprojected to remain at around 77% throughout the outlook period. \\nIn Africa, long-term demand growth will lead to an increase in refinery throughputs of almost \\n 5 mb/d in 2045, up from 2.4 mb/d in 2019. A strong expansion in refining capacities is expected \\nto support this growth trend. Similarly, runs in Latin America will increase by more than 2 mb/d \\nbetween 2019 and 2045, which should not only be supported by an expansion of the refining sys\\n-tem, but also by the higher utilization of existing capacity. Consequently, utilization rates are set \\nto increase strongly in both regions, but still remain at levels below 75% in 2045. It is important \\nto note that higher refinery runs in Africa and Latin America should help to curb product imports \\nfrom other regions. This also means that any failure in refinery run increases, such as through \\npossible project delays, would necessarily lead to higher product imports from other regions.\\n5.2.5 Refinery closures \\nThis section reviews refinery closures in the medium- and long-term with two different approaches. \\nRefinery closure projections in the medium-term include firm and probable closures, largely \\nbased on announcements and analysis on refinery closures. In the long-term (beyond 2026), the \\noutlook is much more uncertain. Analysis is based on projections for regional utilization rates, \\nand a conclusion is drawn on how many closures are needed to keep regional utilization rates at \\n technically and financially sustainable levels. \\nRefinery closures in the medium-term\\nTable 5.5 and Figure 5.19 show actual closures from 2012 and projected closures to 2026. \\nThis year™s Reference Case sees around 4.5 mb/d of refinery closures between 2020 and \\n2026. Following the 2020 demand shock, a wave of closures started, predominantly in three \\nregions Œ US & Canada, Europe and parts of the Asia-Pacific. The downstream market in these \\nregions were showing overcapacity even before COVID-19, with the pandemic accelerating the \\n rationalization process. \\nIn the US & Canada, total closures are estimated at 1.1 mb/d between 2020 and 2026. This includes \\nseveral mid-sized plants, such as the 160 tb/d Martinez plant owned by Marathon, the 120 tb/d San \\nTotal\\n2012Œ20192020202120222023202420252026Total\\n2020Œ2026US & Canada\\n1.2\\n0.60.2\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n1.1\\nLatin America\\n0.3\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.0\\n0.1\\nEurope\\n1.7\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.0\\n0.60.1\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n1.4\\nRussia & Caspian\\n0.2\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\nAfrica\\n0.1\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.1\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.2\\nMiddle East\\n0.8\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n0.0\\nAsia-Pacific\\n1.7\\n0.60.3\\n0.7\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\n0.0\\n1.8\\nTotal\\n6.0\\n1.4\\n0.8\\n0.9\\n0.8\\n0.2\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n4.5\\nTable 5.5\\nRefinery closures by region, recent and projected\\nSource: OPEC.\\nmb/d\\n192\\nFrancisco refinery (Philips 66) and the 130 tb/d refinery in Come by Chance, Canada. All other pro\\n-jected closures in this region are below 100 tb/d, some of which could be converted into biofuel plants.\\nIn Europe, refinery closures by large oil majors, smaller oil companies and trading companies, \\nfor example, Gunvor, are projected at 1.4 mb/d between 2020 and 2026. Several of these plants \\nhave capacities above 100 tb/d, such as refineries in Antwerp (Belgium) and Grandpuits (France). \\nIn addition, a significant number of smaller plants are set to be closed, including Matosinhos \\n(Portugal), Naantali (Finland), Grangemouth (UK) and Rotterdam (Netherlands). On top of firm \\nclosures, there is a large potential for further medium-term closures, thus reflecting the changes \\nin business strategies of some European oil and gas companies. \\nIn the Asia-Pacific, closures are concentrated mostly in developed countries, including Australia, \\nNew Zealand and Japan. Similar to Europe, these closures are partly based on weak demand \\nprospects and the strategy shifts of some oil majors. In Australia, two firm closures have been \\nannounced, Altona and Kwinana, totalling 230 tb/d. Two other refiners in Australia could poten\\n-tially be closed too, which is why the Australian government has offered subsidies to keep them \\nopen in order to ensure security of fuel supply. In New Zealand, the 127 tb/d Marsden Point \\nrefinery is set to close in the coming years. In Japan, two Eneos plants, with around 240 tb/d of \\n capacity, are scheduled for closure. Furthermore, Shell decided to close two plants in the Asia-\\nPacific (Philippines and Singapore) with a total capacity of nearly 350 tb/d. \\nIn addition, this outlook assumes a number of closures in China, affecting smaller, less \\n complex, teapot plants, some of which have already been closed in 2020. In total, around 700 \\ntb/d of refining capacity is expected to be shut down in China and to some extent replaced by new \\nlarge and integrated refinery projects with a focus on petrochemicals (notably the 400 tb/d Yulong \\nPetrochemical project.\\nAs shown in Figure 5.19, the majority of projected closures will occur in the coming years with \\nonly modest shut-ins from 2024 onwards. However, the pace of closures largely depends on the \\ndemand recovery and medium-term prospects. It is possible that some of the projected closures \\nbetween 2021 and 2023 could be delayed and slip into the second half of the medium-term, or \\neven beyond, if demand recovers strongly. \\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.19\\nRefinery closures by region, recent and projected\\nFigure 5.19\\nmboe/dAsia-PacificMiddle EastAfricaRussia & CaspianEuropeLatin AmericaUS & Canada201220132014201520162017201820192020202120222023202420252025Œ0.200.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6mb/d193\\nRefinery closures in the long-term\\nResults for modelling cases in the long-term provide a means to estimate the implied closures \\nrequired within a region. The target for this back calculation is the sustainable average utilization \\nrate. It is important to note that modelling cases already include assumptions on medium-term \\nrefinery closures (4.5 mb/d for the period 2020Œ2026). The parameter for estimating closures in \\nthe long-term is set at around 80%, representing the lowest utilization rate considered viable. \\nThus, model results will indicate some level of implied closures for any region with projected \\n average annual utilization levels below 80%. \\nThe global average utilization by 2025 is projected at 80.5% (Table 5.4). At the regional level, all \\nmajor regions seem to have sufficient average utilization rates, which would not require addi\\n-tional closures in this period. This also means that assumed closures in the medium-term seem \\n appropriate to keep utilization rates at a reasonable level.\\nHowever, beyond 2026 and until 2045, the Reference Case projects the need for further clo\\n-sures as global utilization rates drop to around 76% in 2045. Based on regional demand pat\\n-terns, closures will be required mostly in developed regions. This affects predominantly \\nEurope, the US & Canada, the developed regions of the Asia-Pacific and, to some extent, \\nRussia & Caspian. \\nAt the global level, around 6Œ7 mb/d of refinery closures will be required beyond 2026 and to 2045. \\nThe largest share of this is accounted for by Europe, where further closures of more than 4 mb/d \\nwill be needed to keep refinery utilization rates at levels around 80%. The US & Canada could \\nsee around 1 mb/d of closures in the long-term. As already mentioned, even though oil demand \\nin the US & Canada is set to decline strongly, the region™s refining sector is expected to remain \\n competitive in the international downstream market.\\nIn the Russia & Caspian region, some closures, up to 0.5 mb/d, are also possible given the decline \\nin product exports (Chapter 6). Further closures are likely in developed countries in the Asia-\\nPacific (Japan and South Korea) due to declining demand. Some shut-ins are also possible in \\nother countries of this region, where some old units are still in operation and these will potentially \\nface competition from new refineries that are projected to come online. \\nIn Latin America and Africa, utilization rates in 2045 are projected at levels below 80%. However, \\nas demand increases and many refineries are strategically important for the countries in which \\nthey operate, only limited closures are considered in these regions. \\nBox 5.1\\nThe future of oil refining: adaptation\\nMany of the current trends in the global oil and energy sector will not leave the downstream sec\\n-tor unaffected. There are several challenges, as well as opportunities, in the years ahead, such \\nas the deceleration in global oil demand growth and shifts within the product mix. Furthermore, \\nin line with environmental concerns and rising climate ambitions from many countries, refiner\\n-ies are likely to come under increasing pressure to lower their carbon footprint. Finally, there \\nis an observable policy shift to support demand for alternative fuels, such as biofuels, synthetic \\nfuels and hydrogen, where the refining sector could play an important role. \\n194\\nAs already highlighted in Chapter 3, global demand growth in OPEC™s Reference Case is set \\nto decelerate significantly after an initial period of strong growth during the medium-term. \\nConsequently, global oil demand sees a relatively lengthy period of plateauing in the long-\\nterm, albeit with significant regional differences. At the product level, petrochemical feed\\n-stocks will likely play an increasingly important role in the product mix, accounting for a \\nlarge part of the demand growth to 2045. However, even though there is an expected strong \\nslowdown in demand growth for transportation fuels, they will continue to play a dominant \\nrole in the long-term product slate. \\nThis begs the question for refiners: how to maintain the refinery product slate given these \\nevolving trends? \\nIt is clear that demand growth for petrochemical feedstock will require novel approaches \\nin terms of the design of future refineries, and potentially revamping existing ones. This \\nhas been a clear trend in recent years, with the commissioning of large new refineries with \\npetrochemical integration, especially in Asia and the Middle East, including OPEC Member \\nCountries. Some of these plants can reportedly yield over 50% of petrochemical feedstocks. \\nMany existing refineries are also expanding in this direction, adding petrochemical units and \\nadopting their product slates. Additionally, some Middle East oil companies are interested \\nin strengthening their petrochemical position abroad, mostly in Asia. OTC processes, which \\nhave been around for some time, could also increasingly be employed in the future. \\nIn moving towards the maximization of chemicals production, refiners appear to be targeting \\nnaphtha and primary chemical intermediates, notably aromatics and olefins. While naphtha \\nproduction entails only light processing, olefins and aromatics require extensive processing \\nsteps. These can include the cracking of heavy streams, notably via FCC, hydro-cracking and \\ncatalytic reforming as the most important building blocks from the perspective of a petro\\n-chemicals-integrated refinery, with steam cracking a critical process for converting naphtha \\nand other light hydrocarbon feedstocks. OTC arguably represents the most extreme form of \\nsuch processing. \\nAt the same time, the push for electrification in the transportation sector could potentially \\nlead to strong drops in gasoline and/or diesel demand in some regions, mostly developed \\ncountries. However, it is important to remember that transportation fuels will remain the \\nbaseload for refiners in most developing regions. \\nGiven the demand trends, it is obvious that complex refiners with petrochemical integra\\n-tion will have greater flexibility and an increasingly better overall market position, relative \\nto simple refineries. This is why simple refineries in developed countries might be the first \\nones to be affected by further downstream rationalization waves (more details in Section \\n5.2.5). At the same time, climate-related ambitions and environmental concerns will lead to more \\npressure on refineries to improve energy efficiencies and reduce carbon intensity. It should \\nbe noted that highly-complex and integrated refining plants will not be unaffected by these \\ntrends. This is due to their high energy intensity when it comes to processing. \\nThis refining sector challenge can be addressed through a number of measures, which could \\nhelp realize huge potential for energy savings. Energy efficiency starts with the refinery \\ndesign and the conceptual framework for future, as well as existing refineries. Rising lev\\n-els of digitalization and the implementation of big data could help to better optimize refinery \\n195\\noperations and thus, reduce energy consumption. In addition, fuel switching, for refinery \\noperations, has been advocated as a pathway to more efficient refineries with a lower car\\n-bon footprint. The integration of renewables, such as wind or solar, could help reduce fossil \\nfuel consumption in power generation. \\nAnother central pillar for advancing refining systems is improving the performance of cat\\n-alysts, with enhancements in this area a perpetual work in progress. In many instances \\nand production stages, oxidative processes may also be required, thus oxygen could play a \\ngreater future role. Moreover, when considering a refinery™s immediate site specific envi\\n-ronment, the implementation of district heating can help the refinery recover and utilize \\nexcess heat. \\nCCUS is another technology that should be employed in order to reduce the carbon footprint. \\nSome refinery processes could profit from CCUS, such as OTC or synthetic fuel production, \\nwhich use CO2 as raw materials. \\nIn combination with CCUS and renewables, refineries are also well-positioned to produce \\nlow carbon hydrogen (blue and/or green). Hydrogen production from gasification and partial \\noxidation in refineries will also increase a refinery™s hydrogen potential and open up possi\\n-bilities to introduce more versatility into the feedstock intake, such as solid bio-products and \\nvarious low-value waste streams. Consequently, low carbon hydrogen could be used within \\nthe refinery itself, but also supply hydrogen to the market. In 2021, there have been several \\nannouncements related to the possible expansion of low carbon hydrogen production and \\ntrade, including the establishment of the MENA Hydrogen Alliance. \\nFurthermore, rising demand for alternative fuels, such as hydrogen, biofuels or synthetic \\nfuels could lead to the increasing hybridization of the refining business. This will create \\nopportunities for new business models, which can already be seen. \\nSeveral refiners are integrating plastics recycling (mechanical and chemical), biofu\\n-els or synthetic fuel production at their existing sites, with several projects in Europe. In \\naddition, some refineries after closure, could be fully converted into biofuel plants. For \\ninstance, TotalEnergies announced in 2020 that it would convert its Grandpuits refinery \\n(France) into a plant for biofuels and bioplastics and Eni is considering a comparable strat\\n-egy for its Livorno refinery (Italy). There are other similar projects focused in this direc\\n-tion, mostly in Europe and the US, where long-term oil demand is likely to decline sig\\n-nificantly. While focusing on traditional fuels, refineries in developing countries are also \\nset to play an important role in biofuels and low carbon hydrogen production, in line with \\n rising policy support. \\nFinally, even though these trends will somewhat modify refining business models, it is clear \\nthat the production of traditional fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, will continue to domi\\n-nate the refining business in most regions in the years to come. At the same time, however, \\nthe refinery of the future will be increasingly technology-focused, more energy efficient and \\nmore integrated relative to the conventional refinery set-up. \\nNonetheless, in such a diverse landscape, and with significant regional differences, no one-\\nsolution-fits-all approach can address all possible site-specific issues. Rather, refinery con\\n-figuration will be dependent on local/regional demand patterns, available crude slates and \\nvarious local market conditions, including energy policies. Given their technological capa\\n-bilities, modern oil refining systems are in an ideal position to adapt and evolve, and provide \\nsolutions for the future of the energy sector. \\n196\\n5.3 Secondary capacity\\nRefining capacity is generally denoted by primary distillation capacity. However, it is the \\n secondary capacity that includes conversion and product quality improvement units that are \\ncrucial for processing crude fractions into finished products and which deliver most of a refin\\n-ery™s ‚value-added™. Hence, secondary processes constitute a key gauge of the refining sector™s \\ncapability to meet final product demand.\\nThis section looks into secondary capacity additions in the medium- and long-term by major \\ncategories of secondary units. The development of the secondary capacity goes hand-in-hand \\nwith evolving refined product demand and product specifications, such as sulphur content or \\noctane. \\n5.3.1 Medium-term secondary capacity additions\\nThe 6.9 mb/d of new distillation capacity from medium-term projects (Table 5.2) is expected to be \\naccompanied by an additional 3.7 mb/d of conversion units, 5.9 mb/d of desulphurization capacity \\nand 1.8 mb/d of octane units (Table 5.6). These additions have relatively high complexity levels, rel\\n-ative to the global average, as they include several world-class refineries, especially in the Middle \\nEast and Asia-Pacific. It also reflects demand patterns, which show demand shifting to light prod\\n-ucts, and more stringent sulphur levels, such as the IMO Sulphur Rule introduced in early 2020. \\nBy year\\nConversion\\nDesulphurization*Octane units\\n2021\\n0.7\\n1.7\\n0.5\\n2022\\n1.1\\n1.3\\n0.4\\n2023\\n0.4\\n0.8\\n0.2\\n2024\\n0.4\\n0.60.2\\n2025\\n0.60.8\\n0.3\\n2026\\n0.5\\n0.60.2\\nBy region\\nConversion\\nDesulphurization*Octane units\\nUS & Canada\\n0.0\\n0.2\\n0.0\\nLatin America\\n0.2\\n0.3\\n0.1\\nAfrica\\n0.5\\n0.8\\n0.3\\nEurope\\n0.1\\n0.1\\n0.0\\nRussia & Caspian\\n0.60.4\\n0.1\\nMiddle East\\n0.5\\n2.2\\n0.5\\nChina\\n1.0\\n0.9\\n0.5\\nOther Asia\\n0.8\\n1.0\\n0.3\\nWorld \\n3.7\\n5.9\\n1.8\\nTable 5.6\\nSecondary capacity additions from existing projects, 2021Œ2026\\n* Desulphurization capacity in this table includes naphtha desulphurization.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nmb/d\\n197\\nConversion units\\nFigure 5.20 highlights the geographic distribution of conversion capacity additions by major unit \\ncategory. The 3.7 mb/d in new global conversion units for the period 2021Œ2026 are spread across \\neach of the three main unit categories: 51%, or 1.9 mb/d, for hydrocracking, 25%, or 0.9 mb/d, for \\ncoking/visbreaking (essentially all coking), and 25%, or 0.9 mb/d, for FCC/residue fluid catalytic \\ncracking (RFCC) capacity.\\nIn line with distillation additions, the majority of incremental conversion capacity is located in the \\nMiddle East and Asia-Pacific, with more than 60% of the total. The Middle East is expected to add \\naround 0.5 m/d of new conversion capacity, almost equally distributed among the three catego\\n-ries. In China (+1 mb/d) and Other Asia-Pacific (+0.8 mb/d), there is a clear trend toward hydroc\\n-racking, with its inherent flexibility between light and middle distillates. Africa is set to add around \\n0.5 mb/d of new conversion capacity. Additions in developed countries remain minimal, except for \\nRussia & Caspian where around 0.5 mb/d of new conversion capacity is expected by 2026. These \\nprojects are in line with efforts to upgrade Russia™s refining system. \\nFigure 5.20\\nConversion projects by region, 2021Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.20\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nmb/dOther Asia-PacificŒ0.200.20.40.60.81.01.2US &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia &CaspianMiddleEastChinaOther Asia-Pacificmb/dCoking/VisbreakingFluid catalytic crackingHydrocrackingDesulphurization units\\nGlobal medium-term desulphurization additions are estimated at around 5.9 mb/d. This means \\nthat the ratio of desulphurization relative to distillation capacity is projected at around 85%, which \\nis considerably higher than the current level of 67%. \\nAlmost 70% is set to be located in the Middle East (2.2 mb/d) and Asia-Pacific (1.9 mb/d). Africa is also \\nexpected to add significant desulphurization capacity volumes of around 0.75 mb/d in the medium-\\nterm. All this reflects not only rising oil demand, but tightening product specifications, such as shift\\n-ing to Euro 4Œ6 equivalent standards and AFRI fuel standards. At the same time, other regions are \\nexpected to add less due to lower distillation capacity additions, as well as peaking oil demand. \\nIn the Middle East, the ratio between desulphurization and distillation capacity is at around 130%, \\nwhich is in line with the region™s high-sulphur crude slate. In the Asia-Pacific region and Africa, \\nthis ratio is significantly lower, at between 55% and 65%.\\n198\\nLooking at the different product categories, the majority (more than 50%) of desulphurization \\ncapacity is set to come from middle distillates, around 3 mb/d, which reflects the trend towards \\nlow and ULS standards for diesel. Of the rest, 1.3 mb/d is for naphtha processing, 0.9 mb/d for \\nheavy streams (VGO/residue) and 0.6 mb/d for gasoline. \\nOctane unitsOctane unit increments are estimated at 1.8 mb/d between 2021 and 2026, driven by rising \\n gasoline demand in developing regions, rising octane levels and increasingly growing demand for \\nBTX aromatics. Similar to other secondary units, the majority are expected to be installed in the \\nMiddle East, Asia-Pacific and Africa (around 85%). In other regions where prospects for gasoline \\ndemand are relatively weak, there are only minor medium-term investments. \\nThe majority are set to be for catalytic reforming (1.3 mb/d) and the remainder (0.5 mb/d) attrib\\n-uted to isomerization, alkylation and MTBE/ETBE. The latter projects are predominantly in Asia, \\nnotably China, where there continues to be interest in expanding MTBE use to meet rising gaso\\n-line pool octane requirements.\\n5.3.2 Long-term secondary capacity additions\\nToday, essentially all major projects for new refineries and large expansions comprise \\n complex facilities with high levels of upgrading, desulphurization and related secondary process\\n-ing. Especially for large projects in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, the production of high lev\\n-els of petrochemical feedstocks is a key objective, which is increasingly driving the secondary \\n capacity installations.\\nSmaller projects at existing refineries are generally directed towards the upgrading goals of \\nreducing residual fuel output and achieving quality improvements for clean products. Again, the \\ndriver is that most incremental fuel demand is for light, clean products, including petrochemical \\nfeedstocks.\\nCondensate splitters, which are currently primarily being built in the Middle East are one excep\\n-tion to the overall trend towards increased complexity. Condensate splitter capacity tends to bring \\nwith it only limited secondary processing, often centred on catalytic reforming, isomerization and \\nhydrotreating of lighter fractions.\\nIn setting out to capture outlooks for refining, and especially future processing needs by type of unit, \\nthe WOO modelling has to manage a number of challenges. One is the evolution of refinery process \\ntechnology. This tends to be stable, with only gradual changes, mainly as catalysts slowly improve. \\nThat said, significant process improvements and novel technologies warrant close monitoring. \\nOver the next few years, these developments, and others, could start to materially impact installed \\nrefinery configurations. The current refinery modelling represents proven processes and allows \\nfor gradual efficiency improvements. Novel processes are incorporated only once these are com\\n-mercially proven, and sufficient to have some level of meaningful volume impact.\\nThe emerging trend to increase petrochemical yields represents a second potential modelling \\nchallenge. While many existing refineries in the US and Europe have some degree of petrochemi\\n-cal capability, the number of large integrated refining plus petrochemical ‚mega-projects™ contin\\n-ues to rise, especially in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. It is now possible for a new complex to \\nbe designed to produce 40% or more of petrochemical feedstocks.\\nWith regard to petrochemicals, the modelling undertaken to project the refining outlook is \\ndesigned to match demand for ‚liquids™ as projected by the WOO and other statistical sources. \\n199\\nThe more common roles that refineries play in producing petrochemical feedstocks are, \\n however, included, notably: the use of the FCC unit as a source of propylene; and the use of cata\\n-lytic reformers to feed aromatics (BTX) extraction units and for production of naphtha and LPG. \\nThese are then used as a feedstock to steam crackers and other units, in turn, leading to by-\\n products returning to the refinery as fuel blend stocks.\\nAs in recent outlooks, this year™s projections for future required secondary processing through to \\n2045 (Table 5.7 and Figure 5.21), cover the conventional refinery process technologies that com\\n-prise the vast majority of new units added. Similar to those for crude distillation units, these \\nprojections for secondary process units take into account the 4.5 mb/d of net refinery closures \\nassumed for the period 2020Œ2026. These remove not only distillation, but in many cases, asso\\n-ciated secondary unit capacity. As a result, projected additions, over and above firm projects are \\nsomewhat higher than they would have been had no closures been assumed.\\nAt the global level, projections indicate the need to add some 7.1 mb/d of conversion units, \\n 16.7 mb/d of desulphurization capacity and 4.7 mb/d of octane units in the period 2021Œ2045, to \\ngo with the 14 mb/d of new distillation capacity. It is important to bear in mind that these projec\\n-tions will be influenced, up or down, by several factors, including: the overall level of global liquids \\ndemand; the extent to which this embodies growth or a decline in such streams as gasoline, jet \\nand diesel fuel; and the evolution of the global crude slate between lighter, less sour and heavier, \\nmore sour grades.\\nExisting projects\\nAdditional requirements\\nTotal additions\\nto 2026*\\n2026Œ20352035Œ2045to 2045\\nCrude distillation\\n6.9\\n4.9\\n2.2\\n14.0\\nConversion\\n3.7\\n1.9\\n1.4\\n7.1\\nCoking/visbreaking\\n0.9\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n1.5\\nCatalytic cracking\\n0.9\\n1.0\\n0.7\\n2.6\\nHydrocracking\\n1.90.8\\n0.3\\n3.0\\nDesulphurization**\\n4.5\\n9.1\\n3.1\\n16.7\\nGasoline\\n0.60.5\\n0.3\\n1.4\\nDistillate\\n3.1\\n8.0\\n1.3\\n12.3\\nVGO/residue\\n0.9\\n0.61.5\\n3.0\\nOctane units***\\n1.8\\n1.8\\n1.1\\n4.7\\nCatalytic reforming\\n1.3\\n0.9\\n0.7\\n2.8\\nAlkylation\\n0.2\\n0.5\\n0.3\\n1.0\\nIsomerization\\n0.3\\n0.2\\n0.1\\n0.5\\nMTBE\\n0.0\\n0.3\\n0.1\\n0.4\\nTable 5.7\\nGlobal capacity requirements by process, 2021Œ2045\\n* Existing projects exclude additions resulting from ‚capacity creep™.\\n** Naphtha desulphurization not included.\\n*** New units only (excludes any revamping).\\nSource: OPEC.\\nmb/d\\n200\\nFigure 5.21\\nConversion capacity requirements by process type, 2021Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nThe pace of change in product quality will also be critical, most notably the speed with which \\n developing regions complete the move to Euro 4/5/6 standards for gasoline and diesel, and \\nwhether jet fuel sulphur levels are lowered. Moreover, needed conversion and desulphurization \\nadditions will be sensitive to the extent to which the IMO 2020 Sulphur Rule is met by the use of \\non-board scrubbers, which would allow the continued use of HSFO instead of 0.5% sulphur fuels.\\nFuture scrubber use and penetration has been, and remains, the subject of a number of \\n uncertainties, including whether the use of scrubbed HSFO can survive given the IMO™s target of \\nreducing GHG emissions by 40% from shipping by 2030 \\n(versus\\n 2008 levels) and by 50% by 2050. \\nIn the short-term, however, scrubber sales and installations are buoyant, and HSFO bunker sales \\nhave been much higher at some bunkering ports than was anticipated. The call on the refin\\n-ing industry to add vacuum gasoil (VGO)/residue desulphurization and/or upgrading capacity will \\npartly depend on marine bunker sector developments in the long-term.\\nConversion units\\nAs shown in Table 5.7, existing projects to 2026 have conversion additions at over 54% of new dis\\n-tillation capacity. Along with Figure 5.21, it is indicated that this level is likely to drop to around 42% \\nin the period 2026Œ 2035, and then recover to the 54% level during the period 2035Œ2045. This is as \\ndistillation additions slow in the long-term and as the world™s crude slate trends heavier. \\nThe 0.9 mb/d of coking/visbreaking capacity Œ predominantly coking Œ added via existing projects \\nto 2026 is followed by lower projected additions of 0.2 mb/d from 2026Œ2035, then 0.4 mb/d from \\n2035Œ2045. The slowdown in additions between 2026 and 2035 reflects the large project additions \\nto 2026, combined with a relatively stable global crude slate quality during the period and a mod\\n-est projected recovery in residual fuel demand. The latter is driven by a gradual increase and then \\na plateau in the use of on-board scrubbers.\\nFrom 2035Œ2045, the picture changes. Coking additions continue, as noted, and utilization is \\nexpected to recover appreciably. The key drivers are a projected ‚heavying up™ of the global crude \\nslate between 2035 and 2045, as highlighted in Chapter 4, together with a reduction in residual \\nfuel demand.Figure 5.21\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nmb/d024681012141618Crude distillationConversionOctane unitsDesulphurizationmb/d2021Œ20262026Œ20352035Œ2045201\\nA third of total coking/visbreaking additions (again predominantly coking) are expected to take \\nplace in Latin America and the US & Canada. A recovery in heavy crude production in Latin America \\nand a gradual, but sustained growth in western Canadian oil sands are projected to be the primary \\ndrivers behind this. (It should be noted that the modelling projections exclude oil sands and heavy \\nVenezuelan or other upgraders as they employ projected volumes for crude streams delivered to \\nmarket, i.e. downstream of upgraders and blending.) The remaining additions are spread across \\nthe other world regions. \\nFuture coking additions and utilization levels will be sensitive to heavy crude developments in the \\nMiddle East, and in countries such as Canada, Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, as well as \\nto how residual fuel demand evolves. \\nThis outlook includes the presumption that the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion will go ahead \\naround 2023, increasing western Canadian heavy crude exports to Asia and temporarily reducing \\nthem to the US. Over the longer-term, however, the ongoing oil sands expansion leads to contin\\n-ued growth in imports to the US. Likewise, the projected recovery in Latin America™s heavy crude \\nproduction leads to a gradual rise in such crudes being exported to the US, their historical primary \\nexport market. As a result, coker utilizations are expected to be high in the US Œ in the 85Œ90% \\nrange Œ over the long-term, while those in other regions are projected to be somewhat lower.\\nFluid catalytic cracking (FCC) additions are driven primarily by gasoline demand. Globally, this is \\n projected to rise from around 26 mb/d in 2019 to just above 27 mb/d in 2030, after which it essen\\n-tially plateaus until there is a small drop after 2040. This seemingly static picture, however, masks \\nmajor differences in the evolution of demand between industrialized and developing regions. \\nIn the former (US & Canada, Europe, Japan and Australasia), gasoline demand enters a sustained \\ndecline after 2021, which then accelerates post-2030. In contrast, in developing regions (Latin \\nAmerica, Africa, the Middle East and developing Asia-Pacific) demand grows significantly. The \\nnet effect is that the loss in gasoline demand of nearly 5 mb/d from 2019Œ2045 in industrialized \\nregions is more than offset by demand gains in developing regions. This has major implications \\nfor FCC and other gasoline unit utilizations, capacity additions and closures, and for the gasoline \\ntrade.\\nThe continued growth in developing regions helps sustain the need for new FCC and other \\n gasoline units, despite the parallel demand declines in the industrialized regions. On top of \\n 0.9 mb/d of medium-term projects, FCC additions of 1 mb/d are seen as needed for the period \\n2026Œ2035, then a further 0.7 mb/d for 2035Œ2045. This is in line with the decelerating pace of gas\\n-oline demand growth in developing regions. \\nDriven by the disparity in demand trajectories, a mere 2% of the FCC additions between 2026 \\nand 2045 are projected to be in industrialized and the Russia & Caspian regions. The bulk of the \\nadditions are spread across Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, China and Other Asia-Pacific. \\nCorrespondingly, FCC utilizations are projected to decline steadily to 2045 in the US & Canada, \\nEurope and other industrialized regions. This implies needed FCC closures at refineries in indus\\n-trialized regions that could total at least 0.5 mb/d over the long-term. These could comprise sin\\n-gle unit closures, as has been witnessed in the US, and/or components of total refinery shutdowns \\n(Section 5.2.5.).Conversely, the utilization of FCC units in developing regions is expected to rise gradually over \\nthe long-term. It also needs to be borne in mind that Asia, in particular, has a high proportion of \\nRFCC units and a growing tendency to utilize FCCs to produce propylene for petrochemical feed\\n-stock. These factors, plus the ability to at least partially swing FCC yields away from gasoline and \\ntoward distillates, are included in the modelling and tend to add a degree of resiliency to the FCC \\nas a core upgrading ‚engine™.\\n202\\nHydrocracking units have inherent flexibility to alter yields to emphasize either naphtha/gasoline \\nor distillates. Today, their use is mainly associated with increasing production of the latter (jet/ ker\\n-osene and gasoil/diesel). However, it is worth noting that a few projects in Asia are using hydro-\\ncrackers to produce heavy naphtha as feedstock to catalytic reformers for aromatics (BTX) produc\\n-tion. Global project additions of 1.9 mb/d from 2021Œ2026 are projected to be followed by a further \\n0.8 mb/d from 2026Œ2035, but then much reduced additions of 0.3 mb/d are expected for the period \\n2035Œ2045. This slowing pace for additions is consistent with the projection for a deceleration in \\n distillate demand growth over the longer-term.\\nAs is the case with gasoline, there are marked differences in demand growth patterns between \\nindustrialized and developing regions. Using the same regional groupings as were applied for gas\\n-oline, demand for jet/kerosene plus gasoil/diesel in industrialized regions drops by around 5 mb/d \\nfrom 2019Œ2045, while that for developing regions rises by around 8 mb/d.\\nConsistent with the regional differences in demand growth, hydrocracking additions, beyond \\nprojects, are forecast to be minor in the US & Canada and Europe. Combined, they are only \\naround 1% of the global total. The Russia & Caspian region is expected to see around 6% of \\ntotal additions, while the remaining 90%-plus are again spread across Latin America, Africa, \\nthe Middle East and Other Asia-Pacific. Unlike FCC units, hydrocrackers in industrialized region \\nrefineries are not expected to suffer the same risk of low utilization and closure. Globally, hydro\\n-cracker utilizations are expected to rise gradually over the long-term and generally be in the \\nrange of 75Œ88%.\\nThe regional distribution of total future conversion capacity additions is presented in Figure 5.22. \\nRequirements are expected to be led by the Asia-Pacific, at around 39%, or 2.7 mb/d, of total addi\\n-tions to 2045; and the Middle East, with 16%, or 1.1 mb/d. As percentages of the global total, these \\nlevels are substantial, but lower for the two regions than those for distillation capacity additions, \\nat 46% and 20% of global totals to 2045. This indicates relatively higher proportions of conversion \\nadditions, relative to distillation, in other world regions, in part as existing refineries in nearly all \\nregions raise their processing complexity.\\nFigure 5.22\\nConversion capacity requirements by region, 2021Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.22\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nmb/dOther Asia-PacificUS &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia &CaspianMiddleEastChinaOther Asia-Pacific00.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.6mb/d2021Œ20262026Œ20352035Œ2045203\\nSignificant additions are projected for Latin America and Africa, at around 0.95 mb/d and 1.3 mb/d, \\nrespectively. These are driven by sustained regional product demand growth, with the bulk of \\nadditions in the longer-term. Additions in the Russia & Caspian region to 2045 are estimated at \\n0.7 mb/d, occurring predominantly in the period to 2035. Overall, it is the non-OECD regions that \\nsustain conversion capacity growth over the period to 2045. Only 3% of total conversion capacity \\ngrowth to 2045 is expected in the US & Canada and Europe.\\nDesulphurization units\\nDesulphurization unit additions are projected to continue throughout the outlook period to 2045, \\nbut with the largest additions expected in the period 2026Œ2035. As illustrated in Table 5.7, and \\nalso shown in Figures 5.23 and 5.24, 4.5 mb/d of global projects for 2021Œ2026 are expected to \\nbe followed by some 9.1 mb/d of additions for 2026Œ2035, then 3.1 mb/d for 2035Œ2045. \\nA critical component of secondary capacity, desulphurization additions represent the largest capac\\n-ity increases among all process units over the forecast period. The total of 16.7 mb/d of desulphuri\\n-zation additions by 2045, which excludes over 3 mb/d for naphtha desulphurization, exceeds the 14 \\nmb/d for added distillation capacity. It is evident that while major new refinery projects are designed \\nwith significant built-in desulphurization capacity, the high-level of total desulphurization additions, \\nrelative to distillation, points to substantial desulphurization occurring at existing refineries. This is \\ndue to their processing complexity being raised in order to increase yields of predominantly light, \\nclean products, and as sulphur standards for those products are progressively tightened.\\nSpecifically, the continued move towards near-universal ULS gasoline and diesel standards is a key \\nfactor driving the high level of desulphurization additions. Further drivers are expected reductions in \\nsulphur content for jet fuel and heating oils, as well as marine fuels with the impact of the IMO 2020 \\nSulphur Rule and the possibility of additional Emission Control Areas (ECAs) in the future. The bulk \\nof these changes is expected to be completed by around 2030Œ2035, hence, the pattern of extensive \\nadditions occurring for the period to 2035, followed by much lesser additions for 2035Œ2045. \\nFigure 5.23\\nDesulphurization capacity requirements by region*, 2021Œ2045\\n* Projects and additions exclude naphtha desulphurization.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.23\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nmb/dOther Asia-PacificUS &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia &CaspianMiddleEastChinaOther Asia-Pacific00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.55.0mb/d2021Œ20262026Œ20352035Œ2045204\\nWith the tightening of sulphur standards projected to be essentially complete by 2035, and with a \\nslowing in global liquids demand growth post-2035, desulphurization additions in the long-term \\nare driven largely by a steady increase in global crude slate sulphur levels, from approximately \\n1.2% around 2025, to roughly 1.35% in 2045.\\nThe industrialized regions are already largely at ULS standards for gasoline and diesel. In the \\nperiod to 2026, project additions are thus focused mainly on those regions that are undertaking, or \\ncompleting, steps toward ULS gasoline and diesel standards, notably a series of countries across \\nAfrica, the Middle East and developing Asia, as well as Latin America and the Caspian. The same \\napplies in regions where there is heavy construction of new export refineries geared towards the \\nproduction of Euro 5/6 fuels, notably the Middle East (Figure 5.23).\\nThereafter, to 2035, desulphurization additions are predominantly in developing regions \\nwhere, as already discussed, gasoline, jet fuel and diesel demand growth is expected to con\\n-tinue. The near universality of ULS fuels by 2035 calls for all such incremental demand to be \\ndesulphurized. \\nDriven by demand growth and goals to reach ULS standards, the developing regions of Latin \\nAmerica, Africa, the Middle East and developing Asia account for over 90% of total desulphuriza\\n-tion additions (excluding naphtha desulphurization) to 2045, with the US & Canada plus Europe \\naccounting for only 3%. The remaining 6% are projected to occur in the Russia & Caspian region, \\ndriven by tax incentives to upgrade away from residual fuel and with the intention to produce die\\n-sel and gasoline to ULS standards for both domestic use and export.\\nGasoline desulphurization additions, at a total of 1.4 mb/d by 2045, are focused on developing \\nregions where, as noted, gasoline demand continues to grow and where the shift to ULS stand\\n-ards is still ongoing. Middle distillate additions comprise the bulk (74%) of total desulphurization \\nadditions, excluding naphtha, to 2045. They are anticipated across all regions but, again, with the \\nprimary concentration in developing countries led by the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific, with a \\ncombined 7.3 mb/d, out of a global total of 12.3 mb/d to 2045.\\nFigure 5.24\\nDesulphurization capacity requirements by product and region*, 2021Œ2045\\n* Projects and additions exclude naphtha desulphurization.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.24\\nmboe/dmb/dOther Asia-PacificUS &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia &CaspianMiddleEastChinaOther Asia-Pacific00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.55.0mb/dGasoline/naphthaMiddle distillatesVacuum gasoil/residual fuel205\\nVGO/residue desulphurization is the one category where additions are projected to increase rather \\nthan decline later in the period. Projects to 2026 (Table 5.7) total 0.9 mb/d, in part associated with \\nmeeting increased demand for 0.5% VLSFO, as a result of the IMO 2020 Sulphur Rule. Further \\nadditions are projected at 0.6 mb/d for the 2026Œ2035 period, but are then expected to more than \\ndouble to 1.5 mb/d for 2035Œ2045. Total additions to 2045 are concentrated in the Middle East \\n(31%) and Asia (over 49%), a result of these regions processing large quantities of sour Middle \\nEast and Latin American crudes in the long-term. This is consistent with the anticipated rising \\nshare of heavy crudes in the global crude slate over the projection period. \\nOctane unitsAs shown in Table 5.7, additions for octane units are expected in the period to 2045, with a sustained \\npace through 2035, but slowing thereafter. By 2026, 1.8 mb/d of project additions are expected to be \\nfollowed by another 1.8 mb/d for 2026Œ2035, dropping to 1.1 mb/d for 2035Œ2045. As discussed in \\nrelation to FCC units, one primary driver of octane unit additions is the projected continued growth \\nin gasoline demand in developing regions through 2045, albeit slowing towards the end of the period.\\nA second key driver is the presumed gradual increase in gasoline octane levels built into the mod\\n-elling. Levels are projected to slowly increase in the developing world towards those currently seen \\nin industrialized countries as a series of countries seek to raise their minimum octane standards. \\nLevels in industrialized countries also have the potential to rise in order to improve engine efficien\\n-cies. This progressive increase in octane needs is projected to have largely played out by the longer-\\nterm, reinforcing the tendency for octane unit additions to eventually weaken, notably post-2035.\\nMaintaining the pattern visible in the projects, the majority of octane units are expected to be \\nrequired in the form of catalytic reforming, with a total of 2.8 mb/d to 2045, alkylation at 1 mb/d, \\nisomerization at 0.5 mb/d and MTBE/ETBE units at 0.4 mb/d. Reforming and isomerization raise \\nnaphtha™s octane content and thus enables additional naphtha Œ including that from condensates \\nŒ to be blended into gasoline. MTBE and associated ethers are used (outside the US & Canada) \\neither to meet oxygen content requirements in gasoline, and/or to boost octane levels.\\nFigure 5.25\\nOctane capacity requirements by process and region, 2021Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.25\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nmb/dUS &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia &CaspianMiddleEastChinaOther Asia-Pacific00.20.40.60.81.01.21.4mb/dReformingIsomerizationAlkylationMTBE/ETBE206\\nIn line with other secondary processes, the vast majority (91%) of these additions are projected for \\ndeveloping regions, led by the Asia-Pacific and the Middle East (at 65% combined), and driven by \\nlarge gasoline demand increases and expanding petrochemical industries. (The latter increases \\nthe need for catalytic reforming to produce BTX aromatics.) Latin America and Africa are also pro\\n-jected to have significant octane unit additions as their gasoline standards rise, accounting for \\n12% and 15% of the total additions, respectively. In contrast, the US & Canada, Europe and the \\nRussia & Caspian region together garner the remaining 9% of octane unit additions to 2045. \\n5.3.3 Implications for refined products supply and demand balances\\nIn assessing the effects of capacity additions on regional product balances, it needs to be \\n emphasized that refiners have some limited flexibility to optimize their product slates, depending \\non changing market circumstances and seasonal patterns. This can be done by changing feed\\n-stock composition (crude slate) and by adjusting process unit operating modes. Table 5.8 below \\npresents an estimation of the cumulative potential incremental output of refined products result\\n-ing from existing projects by major product category in the period 2020Œ2026. It also corresponds \\nwith the potential incremental output shown in Section 5.2.3.\\nTotal potential refining capacity in the period 2020Œ2026 is around 7.8 mb/d, assuming utilization \\nof 90%. As already noted, the analysis shows a balance relative to 2019 and does not include refin\\n-ery closures. \\nThe majority of incremental capacity is related to middle distillates, at 3.5 mb/d, or 44%, in line \\nwith strong diesel demand growth in developing regions. Gasoline/naphtha output accounts for \\naround 2.1 mb/d, while potential output of other products is estimated at 2.2 mb/d. Fuel oil, under\\n-standably, has only minor additional capacity from refinery projects in the medium-term. \\nFigure 5.26 shows the balances for the main product classes at the regional level. It is calculated \\nbased on the incremental refining potential by product (Table 5.8) and the regional incremental \\ndemand by product. Non-refinery streams are deducted in order to get only demand for refined \\nproducts. \\nFigure 5.26\\nExpected surplus/deficit* of incremental product output from existing refining projects, \\n2021Œ2026mboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nmb/dWorldUS &CanadaEuropeMiddleEastAsia-PacificOtherregions0.00.51.01.52.02.5mb/dGasoline/NaphthaMiddle distillatesResidual fuelOther products* Declining product demand in some regions contributes to the surplus.\\nSource: OPEC.\\n207\\nGasoline/NaphthaMiddle\\ndistillates\\nFuel\\noilOtherproducts\\nTotal\\n2020\\n0.4\\n0.7\\nŒ0.1\\n0.4\\n1.3\\n2021\\n0.7\\n1.2\\n0.0\\n0.62.5\\n2022\\n1.0\\n1.8\\n0.1\\n1.0\\n3.8\\n2023\\n1.2\\n2.2\\n0.1\\n1.4\\n5.0\\n2024\\n1.5\\n2.6\\n0.1\\n1.7\\n5.8\\n2025\\n1.8\\n3.1\\n0.1\\n1.96.9\\n2026\\n2.1\\n3.5\\n0.1\\n2.2\\n7.8\\n27%\\n44%\\n1%28%\\n100%\\nTable 5.8\\nGlobal cumulative potential for incremental product output*, 2020Œ2026\\n* Based on assumed 90% utilization rates for the new units.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nThe estimated cumulative surplus by 2026 is around 4.6 mb/d, as previously explained (Section \\n5.2.3). Figure 5.26 shows the most significant overhang for middle distillates estimated at \\n 2.3 mb/d cumulative by 2026. Demand growth for middle distillates remains weak in the medium-\\nterm, due to switching away from diesel in the road transportation sector and only moderate \\nrecovery in the aviation sector. The largest overhang of middle distillates is expected in the Middle \\nEast, followed by the US & Canada and Europe. In the Middle East, the overhang is the result of \\nexpanding refining capacity, while in the US & Canada and Europe, the surplus comes from declin\\n-ing demand for this product. \\nGasoline/naphtha show an overhang of 0.8 mb/d for the period 2020Œ2026. The largest part of \\nthis overhang is located in the US & Canada at 0.4 mb/d, mostly due to declining demand. Other \\nregions show moderate gasoline/naphtha overhangs, such as Europe and the Middle East. The \\nbalance for fuel oil shows surpluses in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, at around 0.15 mb/d each, \\nwhile other regions are balanced. In the category ‚Other products™, the global cumulative overhang \\nto 2026 is estimated at around 1.15 mb/d, with the largest surpluses in Europe. \\nAs already noted, it is important to state that this balance does not include projected closures to \\n2026, which are estimated at around 4.5 mb/d (Section 5.2.5). If they all materialize, the market \\nwould be more balanced with some products possibly in deficit for the period 2020Œ2026.\\n5.4 Investment requirements\\nDownstream sector investment requirements are shown in three separate categories \\n (Figure 5.27). The first category relates to existing (identified) projects, which are expected to come \\nonline in the medium-term (2021Œ2026) and as described in Section 5.1. This category includes \\nthe real investment costs to the extent possible, and if reported. The second category is related \\nto investments beyond 2026 and generally represents still generic projects in the long-term. The \\nthird category focuses on the continuous maintenance of the global refining system and covers \\nnecessary capital replacements throughout the projection period (2021Œ2045).\\nFor the first category, the total investment requirement is estimated at just below $250 billion, \\nwhich is significantly higher relative to WOO 2020 projections. It is in line with expected medium-\\nterm capacity expansions of 6.9 mb/d in the current Outlook. Investments of almost $172 billion, \\n208\\nor 77%, are accounted for by the Middle East and Asia-Pacific (including China), as most new pro\\n-jects come from these regions. Africa is projected to also have significant investments of $27 bil\\n-lion, an increase of more than $10 billion from the WOO 2020, given the more optimistic prospects \\nfor new refining capacity. Investments in other regions are moderate, led by the Russia & Caspian \\n($19 billion), Latin America ($14 billion) and the US & Canada ($10 billion), mostly dedicated to \\nexpansion projects at existing plants. Finally, Europe is likely to see only $5 billion of medium-\\nterm investments into the downstream sector. \\nBeyond 2026 and to 2045, total investments into new refining projects are expected at $192 \\nbillion. In line with the capacity outlook, there is a significant slowdown in the rate of down\\n-stream investments. Similar to the medium-term, major investments will be located in devel\\n-oping regions. More than half of the investments are accounted for by the Middle East and \\nAsia-Pacific (including China). However, in the long-term, investments in other regions, such \\nas Africa and Latin America, are considerably higher relative to the medium-term at $36 billion \\nand $29 billion, respectively, as more capacity is projected to come online. New refining capaci\\n-ties are required in both regions in order to reduce product imports in the midst of expanding \\noil demand. Developed regions (the US & Canada, Europe and Russia & Caspian) see only minor \\ninvestment levels, totalling $22.5 billion.\\nFinally, for maintenance and replacement costs the required investments are estimated at around \\n$1 trillion between 2021 and 2045. These investments are needed in all regions led by the Other \\nAsia-Pacific and the US & Canada.\\n5.5 Refining industry implications\\nEven before the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the global downstream market was exhibiting \\ncapacity surpluses, and previous editions of the WOO pointed to the need for medium-term refin\\n-ery closures. The demand shock of 2020, and the uncertainty related to future demand develop\\n-ments, led to a wave of refinery closures, and more are expected in the coming years. A total of \\n 4.5 mb/d of refining capacity is set to be closed between 2020 and 2026, mostly in developed \\nFigure 5.27\\nRefinery investments by region, 2021Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 5.27\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\nmb/dUS &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia &CaspianMiddleEastChinaOther Asia-PacificMaintenance/Capacity replacementRequired additionsExisting projects050100150200250300350400$ (2021) billion209\\nregions. Many of the plants scheduled for closure are less efficient, smaller in size and with no \\npetrochemical integration. Closures should help to stabilize the downstream sector and return \\nrefining utilization rates to sustainable levels in the medium-term. \\nNevertheless, the uncertainty related to oil demand growth remains, and could possibly lead \\nto further closure announcements in the medium-term. At the regional level, the downstream \\nsectors in developing countries are likely to be more resilient thanks to expanding demand. At \\nthe same time, as demand starts declining in developed countries, refiners in the US & Canada, \\ndeveloped Asia-Pacific and Europe will continue to see pressure, even after the current wave of \\nclosures. \\nIn the long-term, slowdowns in demand growth over the long-term will mirror the dynamics in the \\nglobal and regional downstream market. Global refinery throughputs are set to start plateauing \\nfrom 2035 onwards, and the need for additional capacity will begin to decline. In the last five years \\nof the outlook, only minimal additions will be required at the global level. That means that construc\\n-tion of large refining projects towards the end of the outlook period becomes increasingly unlikely. \\nAt the regional level, the migration of refining capacity to developing countries is expected to \\ncontinue, with most of the new capacity being commissioned in the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, \\nAfrica and Latin America. A large number of new plants are anticipated to have petrochemical \\n integration, thus providing a ‚hedge™ against demand decline for traditional fuels. \\nFurthermore, refineries in developed countries are likely to build biofuel capacities and possibly \\nintegrate CCUS as a result of more stringent energy policies. In line with this, the closure of some \\nfacilities will mean the start of a new life cycle. Some plants are likely to be converted into biofuel \\nor hydrogen production plants, as strategies shift among oil and gas companies. Nevertheless, \\nnew plant capacities are likely to be smaller in size. In order to ensure business sustainability, \\nsupportive energy policies seem decisive for these conversions, at least for the foreseeable future. \\nFinally, the uncertainty over energy policies and related implications on oil demand remain\\n significant (see Chapter 8). Lower-than-expected oil demand in the long-term would most prob\\n-ably mean more pressure on utilization rates, and, in turn, lead to fewer project additions and/or \\nmore closures. Nevertheless, even though the downstream sector is projected to face numerous \\nchallenges as it approaches maturity, it will remain a large and important part of the global oil \\nand gas industry. \\n210\\nOil movements\\n211\\nKey takeaways\\nŁ The COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on global oil trade in 2020. Global \\n interregional movements, including crude, condensate and refined products, fell from \\n 57 mb/d in 2019 to just below 50 mb/d in 2020, due to the oil demand drop and related \\nsupply adjustments. In the medium-term, global oil trade is expected to recover to \\n pre-COVID levels, before gradually reaching 61.5 mb/d in 2045. \\nŁ After the 2020 drop, global crude and condensate trade is projected to reach levels above \\n38 mb/d in 2025 and 2030 and then 40 mb/d and above from 2035 onwards, supported by \\nincreased oil demand in the Asia-Pacific and rising crude and condensate supply in the \\nMiddle East. \\nŁ Middle East crude and condensate exports are projected to return to pre-COVID levels \\nof around 18 mb/d in 2025, with levels to some extent limited by rising local crude use \\nand increasing exports from other regions. In the longer-term, exports are set to rise to \\nalmost 23 mb/d in 2045, in line with rising OPEC liquids demand. \\nŁ The main destination for Middle East crude and condensate barrels will be the Asia- \\nPacific region, with volumes increasing from around 15 mb/d in 2019 to just above \\n 19.5 mb/d in 2045. However, Europe, along with the US & Canada, remain important \\nexport outlets for the Middle East. \\nŁ Based on rising oil supply, Latin American crude and condensate exports are set to \\nincrease and reach almost 5 mb/d by 2025, remaining above 4 mb/d throughout the out\\n-look period. The main destinations for Latin American barrels include the US & Canada, \\nthe Asia-Pacific, and moderate volumes to Europe. \\nŁ Crude and condensate exports from the Russia & Caspian are mostly stable at levels just \\nbelow 7 mb/d throughout the outlook period, with a rising focus on the Asia-Pacific and \\ndecreasing shipments to Europe. \\nŁ African crude and condensate exports are expected to decline from almost 6 mb/d in \\n2019 to around 4.7 mb/d in 2045, as local crude use increases significantly. Most of the \\nAfrican volumes are projected to leave for Europe and the Asia-Pacific.\\nŁ Based on supply patterns, crude and condensate flows from the US & Canada are seen \\nrising to 4 mb/d in 2025, but start declining thereafter, dropping to 1.7 mb/d by 2045. At \\nthe same time, crude and condensate imports to the US & Canada (mostly heavier bar\\n-rels), are expected to reach almost 3.5 mb/d in 2025 and then decline to around 2.5 mb/d \\nfor the rest of the period. \\nŁ Europe™s crude and condensate imports are set to drop by 3 mb/d between 2019 and \\n2045, in line with declining demand and despite an expected drop in local production. \\nŁ The Asia-Pacific region is the main outlet for crude and condensate flows, with total \\nimports increasing from 23.5 mb/d in 2019 to almost 30 mb/d in 2045. Latin America and \\nthe US & Canada are set to increase their exports in the medium-term, while shipments \\nfrom the Russia & Caspian, along with the Middle East, increase significantly after 2030.\\n212\\nOil trade movements are an indispensable part of the global oil market and enable the integration \\nof different regions into the overall global system. They help balance out the market, while tak\\n-ing into account oil supply and demand trends. This integration increases producer and consumer \\nflexibility and reduces possible demand and supply shocks. \\nThis chapter examines the main trends related to the trade movements of crude oil and con\\n-densates, as well as intermediate and refined products, between major regions. Projections are \\nbased on the assumptions and modelling results discussed throughout this Outlook, including oil \\ndemand, supply and refining. Projections on trade movements also include assumptions regard\\n-ing logistics developments.\\n6.1 Logistics developments\\nThe development of logistics infrastructure is crucial for maintaining oil trading and exporting \\ncapacity and the availability of products for markets. For this reason, significant interregional \\ndevelopments have a major impact on oil flows and are considered among the key inputs in the \\nmodelling of global trade movements.\\nBoth crude oil and product movements are impacted and altered by the infrastructure that is \\ndeveloped. Developments in land-based infrastructure Œ mainly pipelines and, to a lesser extent, \\nrail systems Œ affect both short- and long-distance inland and marine movements. International \\nmarket access and export flexibility are especially impacted by infrastructure development, \\nincluding long-distance pipelines, coastal terminals and berthing capacity for moving crude oil, \\nproducts and other liquid hydrocarbons.\\nCertain regions require continuous attention because of their potential to alter interregional crude \\ntrade. This applies especially to China, the Middle East, the Russia & Caspian, along with the US \\n& Canada.6.1.1 The US & CanadaThe upending of US and Canadian crude oil supply and logistics that occurred in 2020 due to the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic continued into 2021 and will likely reverberate for years to come. COVID-\\ninduced financial difficulties and production declines for US shale producers, combined with \\nnew pipelines to the Gulf Coast, have dramatically altered the logistics capacity balance. Logistic \\n constraints shifted into a logistics surplus for most movements. \\nIn parallel, political and legal challenges continue to delay some pipelines, and in some cases \\ncancellations have occurred. The most notable was the recent denial by the Biden Administration \\nof permits for Keystone XL, arguably ending the project. As a result, the logistics outlook remains \\nuncertain, which has been the case for the past few years.\\nUSUS crude oil and condensate exports (excluding NGLs), which had reached 3 mb/d by mid-2019, \\nbroadly stayed at that level through 2020 and into the first half of 2021. While at first glance this \\nmay seem somewhat surprising, it must be recognized that exports are predominantly very light \\nstreams not readily suited to US refineries. Additionally, during COVID-19, US production dropped, \\nas did US refinery runs. The vast majority of US exports, some 2.75 mb/d, were and are from the \\nUS Gulf Coast, highlighting the reality that infrastructure developments in that region are critical \\nto the overall US logistics picture. \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact; while some projects have continued to move \\nahead, others have been delayed or cancelled. The Wink-to-Webster project was delayed from \\n213\\nearly 2020 to late 2020, but has since started service. This provides 1 mb/d of takeaway capacity \\nfrom the Permian Basin to destinations in the Houston area. The 400 tb/d EPIC pipeline was com\\n-missioned in April 2020. Yet, several other large projects have been put on hold or cancelled out\\n-right, including the 1 mb/d Jupiter project and the 450 tb/d ECHO 4 project.\\nDespite the cancellation of several projects, and given the setbacks to US production, the rapid \\nbuild-out of pipeline capacity over the past few years has left the US with ample takeaway capac\\n-ity, especially from the Permian/Eagle Ford Basins and Cushing. Even allowing for the 3.2 mb/d \\nrecovery in US tight oil production expected in this Outlook by 2026, \\nversus\\n 2021, Permian/Eagle \\nFord takeaway capacity Œ now close to 8 mb/d Œ should be sufficient, with arguably no new pipeline \\nprojects required to handle Permian production.\\nThe reversal of the Capline and expansion of the Dakota Access pipeline, both designed to bring \\ncrude from the US interior to the Gulf Coast, have been delayed, but plans are still in place to com\\n-plete them in late 2021. While, like the Permian, the US interior has sufficient takeaway capacity \\nwith planned and existing pipelines, there are regulatory uncertainties that could impact this, as \\ndiscussed later. However, the Bakken region, in particular, has a large amount of rail capacity that \\ncan act as a buffer to mitigate potential pipeline problems, notably if Dakota Access were to end \\nup being shut down rather than expanded.\\nMuch of the crude oil moved on new pipelines to the Gulf Coast is destined for export markets, \\nrequiring upgrades to export facilities. Like pipeline projects, what was once a bevy of port expan\\n-sions has also faced delays or cancellations as a result of the impacts of COVID-19. \\nThere are two leading offshore very large crude carrier (VLCC) loading projects Œ the Enterprise SPOT \\nterminal offshore Houston and the Phillips 66 Trafigura Bluewater project offshore Corpus Christi Œ \\nthat remain active, but both continue to face delays and are unlikely to be completed before 2023, if \\nat all. This leaves the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) and Ingleside as the only VLCC-capable US \\ncrude export terminals. Originally designed to take imports, and to work with Capline to take mainly \\nimported crudes into the US interior, LOOP has also been exporting local Gulf of Mexico medium sour \\ncrudes and light sweet grades since 2019. It should also be noted that Ingleside, just purchased by \\nEnbridge, sited adjacent to the Port of Corpus Christi, can accept crude and condensates from sev\\n-eral pipelines out of the Permian and Eagle Ford and is being expanded to enable dual VLCC loading.\\nAmplifying the upheaval to projects as a result of the dramatic supply and demand changes due \\nto COVID-19, resistance continues to new pipeline developments and existing pipeline infrastruc\\n-ture. Most projects today are the subject of lawsuits, including at the state level. In addition, state \\nregulatory authorities more frequently require lengthy reworking and extensions of environmen\\n-tal reviews. Several recent rulings in federal courts regarding the inadequacy of environmental \\nreviews have resulted in project delays and higher costs.\\nThe current US Administration has placed renewed emphasis on reducing GHG emissions. In this \\ncontext, new projects to move hydrocarbons are frequently seen as undesirable. One of the first \\nactions of the Biden Administration was to revoke the cross-border permit for the Keystone XL \\npipeline. Operator TC Energy subsequently cancelled the project, ending a 13-year attempt to \\nbuild the pipeline.Furthermore, in July 2020, a federal court ordered that the 570 tb/d Dakota Access pipeline out of the \\nBakken be shut down pending further environmental review. This marked the first time an existing \\npipeline has been ordered shut. Subsequent rulings have allowed the pipeline to remain operating \\nuntil an environmental review is completed, potentially in March 2022, but its future is not certain. \\nIn mid-2020, a second operating pipeline, the 200 tb/d High Plains line out of the Bakken, was also \\nordered shut while its owners negotiated a renewal of their right-of-way with landowners. While the \\n214\\npipeline is currently operating, the legal dispute is ongoing, highlighting a new reality of uncertainty \\nthat hangs over the continued operation of existing pipelines, let alone new or unfinished projects. \\nAs discussed below, Enbridge™s Line 5 renewal project continues to meet resistance. The bottom line \\nis that it is becoming increasingly difficult for US operators to build major new pipelines and that a \\nnumber of currently operating pipelines face costly lawsuits and the risk of closure.\\nCanada Cross-border pipelines and projects from Canada into the US impact both countries. As noted ear\\n-lier, the current outlook is for Canadian crude and condensate production to see minor increases \\nin the medium- to long-term of 0.25 mb/d from 2021Œ2030 and the same again from 2030Œ\\n2040. On this basis, few additions to takeaway capacity are needed for the next few years. Minor \\n debottlenecking projects and system optimization on both ‚mainline™ (Enbridge and TC Energy) \\nand secondary cross-border pipelines could add up to an additional 225 tb/d by 2022. \\nIn principle, these upgrades should be more than enough to cover medium-term Western \\nCanadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) production increases, but unless all are implemented pipe\\n-line takeaway capacity from Western Canada could once again become tight. The takeaway system \\nalso includes significant crude-by-rail capacity, a ‚nameplate™ of 850 tb/d. Although more costly \\nthan movement via pipeline, exports by rail have averaged close to 150 tb/d for each of 2019 and \\n2020 and have previously demonstrated the ability to reach over 400 tb/d.\\nFuture takeaway capacity could be impacted by new processes and technologies. So-called dil\\n-uent recovery units are being constructed, which improve the economics of crude-by-rail by \\n reducing the amount of diluent needed. \\nLikewise, there is an interest in new processes that would partially upgrade bitumen, reducing \\nor even eliminating the associated diluent needed for shipment via pipeline and thereby freeing \\nup pipeline capacity. One such process, which centres on removing heavy asphaltenes, has seven \\nunits installed or planned (some in China) with a capacity of up to 20 tb/d. \\nFinally, CN Rail has developed a technology (CanaPuxŽ) to safely move undiluted bitumen by \\nrail as solid ‚pucks™ (the shape of small bricks), which will not contaminate if spilled. Unlike cur\\n-rent means of crude-by-rail, CanaPuxŽ are moved in regular coal-type rail cars, reducing freight \\ncosts. CN Rail is reported to have a 10,000 b/d demonstration facility starting in 2021. Should this \\nprocess prove commercially successful, it would alleviate pressure on both takeaway pipelines \\nand conventional crude-by-rail. Asia is seen as a primary market for this product. \\nIn terms of major pipeline developments, Western Canada continues to be beset by delays \\nand cancellations involving long-planned projects and faces issues in terms of restoring and \\n maintaining capacity on existing exit pipelines.\\nThe largest such cross-border project, Keystone XL, would have transported 830 tb/d of mainly \\nheavy Canadian crude to the US Gulf Coast, supplying additional barrels to regional refiners. The \\nline would have also opened up the possibility for WCSB crude oil exports via the Gulf Coast. \\nHowever, as already described, TC Energy formally terminated the project in June after the new \\nUS Administration revoked a presidential cross-border permit. \\nAnother significant cross-border project is the Enbridge Line 3 Replacement. This project is slated \\nto restore the line™s original capacity by replacing the ageing existing pipeline. In doing so, it would \\nadd an effective 370 tb/d to cross-border capacity. While construction is still subject to resistance \\nand litigation, shipments on the renewed and expanded system are projected to start in October \\n2021.215\\nEnbridge is also locked in a dispute with the State of Michigan over how and when to replace an\\n underwater section of Line 5, which has a capacity of 540 tb/d and carries crude oil and NGLs from \\nWestern Canada to the US Midwest and to Ontario. The state has sued to close the line permanently \\nover fear of leaks, while Enbridge is seeking state and federal permits for a new 8 km tunnel to replace \\nthe existing exposed section of the ageing underwater line. The State of Michigan has ordered the \\npipeline shut as of May 2021, however, it continues to operate while Enbridge appeals the decision.\\n The Keystone XL cancellation and the issues surrounding Line 3 and Line 5 arguably render even \\nmore critical a project to expand the Trans Mountain pipeline from 300 tb/d to 890 tb/d for the \\nWCSB. Crucially, this project would enable Canada to open up export markets other than the US, \\nsince it would lead to most, or all, of the additional crude volumes being shipped by tanker from \\nthe pipeline™s Westridge terminal near Vancouver. \\nIn 2018, the Canadian government undertook what some deemed to be the extreme move of \\npurchasing the pipeline project from Kinder Morgan. A series of subsequent court actions cul\\n-minated in early July 2020 when the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed an appeal by British \\nColumbia™s First Nations, thereby authorizing the project to go ahead. Resistance is still active \\nin British Columbia, however, and various permits are outstanding. Construction began in 2020, \\nbut it has faced several COVID-related delays. The line is now expected to be in service by the \\nend of 2022.Should the two remaining major expansion projects Œ namely Trans Mountain Expansion and Line \\n3 Replacement Œ go ahead, they will add nearly 1 mb/d of new exit capacity from Western Canada. \\nCombined with other minor debottlenecking that could add another 225 tb/d, the total new takea\\n-way capacity could be well above the latest projection for WCSB supply growth through 2030. In \\ncontrast to periods in the recent past, infrastructure would no longer constrain WCSB supply from \\nreaching markets. However, should the Line 5 project Œ or some other pipeline Œ be ordered shut, \\na constrained situation would likely recur.\\nIn terms of the effects on international oil trade, the Trans Mountain expansion is likely to have the \\nlargest impact, since it is the one project that would move WCSB crudes to the US West Coast and \\nAsia rather than to the US Gulf Coast.\\nWhat does appear certain is that the high-paced build-out of pipelines and related infrastructure \\nin the US (and Canada) in recent years is now over. The likelihood that any major new pipeline pro\\n-jects will be announced over the next several years appears low. It seems that it will be some time, \\nif ever, before logistics capacity once again becomes a constraint to supplying US and Canadian \\ncrudes to market. \\nAdditionally, the demand collapse in 2020 and heightened environmental concerns have rein\\n-forced arguments against allowing new capacity. The difficulties and costs of getting projects built \\nare now accompanied by a new element, namely uncertainty over the continuing operation of \\nexisting pipelines. Should the latter trend begin to have material impacts, such as forced pipeline \\nclosures, then a difficult and constrained situation could emerge.\\n6.1.2 Other regions\\nAs for other regions, there are no major updates relative to last year™s WOO. Russia expanded the \\ncapacity of its ESPO pipeline to China and the Pacific coast to 1.6 mb/d in late 2019. Currently, there \\nare no further projects on this route, but in the longer-term, expansions are possible, given the \\n rising focus of Russia on the Asian oil market.\\nFurthermore, the CPC pipeline, which brings Kazakh crude to the Black Sea, has started a debot\\n-tlenecking project, which should help to further increase pipeline capacity. According to official \\n216\\nannouncements, pipeline capacity should increase to 1.6 mb/d by 2023, which is in line with the \\nexpected increase in Kazakh oil production (see Chapter 4). \\n6.2 Crude oil and product movements\\nThe integrated global downstream sector relies on the ability to move crude oil, condensates, \\nrefined products and various intermediate streams between countries and regions, driven by eco\\n-nomics. The infrastructure (pipelines and shipping capacity) enable market participants to move \\nlarge amounts of oil liquids (crude or products) between almost any two regions of the world, over \\nshort and long distances, via a variety of transport modes. \\nThese interregional movements enable physical supply, as well as trade and competition, as they \\nrespond to price signals between regions. The ability to move crude oil and products also helps \\navoid short-term shortages of fuel in specific regions at a given time. For example, the market™s \\nability to respond to price signals and swiftly deploy tankers or other logistics can help offset \\nshortages caused by weather-related issues, as has been proven in the past.\\nVarious factors affect the direction and volume of crude and condensate, as well as product trade \\nmovements. These include demand levels; the production and quality of crude and non-crude \\nstreams; product quality specifications and related changes; refining sector configurations; trade \\nbarriers or policy-driven incentives; the capacity and economics of existing transport infrastruc\\n-ture, such as ports, tankers, pipelines and railways; ownership interests; term contracts; price \\nlevels and differentials; freight rates; and, at times, geopolitics. In fact, there is never only one fac\\n-tor influencing the flow of petroleum, rather a combination of several influences at the same time.\\nThe downstream sector and its development are key elements in this regard. Based on the eco\\n-nomics of oil movements and refining, there is a general preference to locate refining capacity in \\nconsuming regions due to lower transport costs for crude oil compared with oil products. \\nStrategic reasons also play a role. Recent trends in the downstream sector clearly confirm this Œ the \\nmajority of refining capacity additions in recent years have materialized in developing regions with \\nstrong oil demand growth, led by the Asia-Pacific. As a result, crude and condensate account for the \\nmajority of trade, especially over long distances. However, refining hubs in developed countries with \\nhighly complex plants, such as in the US, are competing increasingly in the international product \\nmarket, in line with slower domestic demand growth and available feedstock at competitive prices.\\nFurthermore, for producing and consuming countries alike, there is an emphasis on securing \\nrefined product supply through domestic refining rather than imports, regardless of economic \\nfactors. For producing countries, there is the additional consideration of seeking to increase \\ndomestic refining capacity in order to not only cover domestic demand, but also to benefit from the \\nexport of value-added products beyond crude oil. As an extension of this strategy, in their efforts \\nto secure future outlets for crude production, some producing countries may choose to partici\\n-pate jointly in refining projects in consuming countries, especially where long-term contracts for \\nfeedstock supply can be arranged. For instance, various companies from the Middle East, build\\n-ing upon existing capacity, seek to participate in downstream projects in the Asia-Pacific region.\\nGiven the considerations highlighted, oil movements are not always the most economical or \\nefficient in terms of minimizing overall global costs. In contrast, movements generated in the \\nmodels used for this Outlook are based on an optimization procedure that seeks to minimize \\nglobal costs across the entire refining/transport supply system in accordance with existing and \\n additional refining capacity, logistical options and costs.\\nGenerally, few constraints are applied to crude oil and product movements in the modelling \\napproach, especially in the longer-term, for which it is impossible to predict what ownership \\n217\\ninterests and policies of individual companies and countries might be. The differences between \\nshort-term market circumstances, such as constraints resulting from ownership interests and \\nterm contracts, and a modelling approach that looks at the longer-term, with few restrictions on \\nmovement and that operates by minimizing global costs, mean it is necessary to recognize that \\nmodel-projected oil movements cannot fully reflect short-term factors. Therefore, they may pro\\n-ject oil trade patterns that are not direct extensions of those that occur today. Historical volatility \\nin tanker freight rates and the difficulties in predicting where they may be in two, five or ten years, \\nadd to the uncertainties in projecting future oil movements.\\nNevertheless, the model-based results presented in this section provide a useful indication of future \\ncrude oil movement trends, which necessarily function to resolve regional supply and demand \\nimbalances for both crude and products. These projections are, of course, dependent on a num\\n-ber of assumptions in this Outlook, which, if altered, could materially impact projected movements.\\nKey elements in the model-based projections are the volumes and qualities of both crudes pro\\n-duced and products consumed by region, and how these change over time. Another element is \\nthe location and capability of refining capacity. Over the longer-term, the relative economics of \\nbuilding new refinery capacity in different regions, and the ability of existing refineries to export \\nand compete against imports, all affect the trade patterns of crude and products. There is also \\nan interplay between freight and refining costs. Broadly, higher freight rates tend to curb inter\\n-regional trade and encourage more refining investment, while lower freight rates tend to enable \\ngreater trade and competition between regions, and serve to provide more opportunity to regions \\nwith spare refining capacity to export products.\\nFigure 6.1 shows global oil (crude oil, condensates and refined products) between seven major \\nregions, excluding intratrade between countries within regions. Projections are made for anchor \\nyears only (2025, 2030, 2035, 2040 and 2045), to illustrate the main long-term trends. As already \\nmentioned, these projections are in line with demand projections (Chapter 3), supply projections \\n(Chapter 4) and the outlook for the refining sector (Chapter 5). \\nAs shown in Figure 6.1., global oil trade was estimated at around 56.2 mb/d in 2019, before \\ndropping to around 49.5 mb/d in 2020 due to the oil demand drop caused by the outbreak of the \\nFigure 6.1\\nInterregional crude oil* and products exports, 2019Œ2045\\n* Including condensates.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.1\\nmboe/d0102030405060702019202020252030203520402045mb/dCrude oilProducts218\\nCOVID-19 pandemic. However, recovering oil demand in OPEC™s Reference Case is expected to \\nlead to an oil trade rebound in the medium- and long-term.\\nIn 2025, global oil trade is projected at around 58 mb/d, followed by a drop in 2030 to 56 mb/d, as \\nmore oil is consumed in large producing regions such as Africa and Latin America. This is also in \\nline with new refining capacity additions in these regions, which reduces crude and condensate \\nexports and refined product imports. However, beyond 2030, oil imports are expected to increase \\ngradually and reach levels of 61.5 mb/d in 2045. This is slightly lower relative to last year™s WOO \\nand in line with downward long-term oil demand revisions (see Chapter 3). \\nAfter the strong decline in 2020 to around 34 mb/d, crude and condensate trade is expected to \\nreach levels of around 39 mb/d in 2025 and 2030. By 2040, crude and condensate movements \\nreach 41 mb/d, in line with rising oil demand and declining supply in some consuming regions, \\nsuch as the Asia-Pacific. Crude and condensate trade is then expected to decline slightly in the \\nperiod to 2045, but remain above the 40 mb/d threshold. \\nLooking at the refined product side, trade levels declined by more than 2 mb/d between 2019 and \\n2020, reaching almost 15.5 mb/d in 2020. However, rising oil demand in consuming regions, such \\nas Africa and the Asia-Pacific, is expected to lead to higher product trade flows in the medium- \\nand long-term. Consequently, total product flows are estimated at above 19 mb/d by 2025. In 2030, \\nthere is a temporary drop in overall product flows to 17.5 mb/d (similar to 2019 levels), in line with \\nlower import needs in Africa, along with the US & Canada. \\nBeyond 2030, total product flows increase gradually again to levels above 21 mb/d by 2045. This is \\nsupported by increasing product exports from developed regions, such as US & Canada, where oil \\ndemand declines and thus some refining capacity would increasingly turn to export markets, such \\nas Latin America, Africa and the Asia-Pacific. \\n6.3 Crude oil and condensate movements \\nIn order to provide background, this section first discusses changes in crude and condensate sup\\n-plies by major region in the medium- and long-term. It then turns to the main trends in crude oil \\nand condensate movements at the regional level, showing trade flows from the perspective of the \\nmain exporting and importing regions.\\nCrude and condensate supply\\nWhile global crude and condensate supply (excluding NGLs) increases only modestly \\n throughout the outlook period, there are significant regional differences in supply patterns. \\nSimilar to previous outlooks, the medium-term perspective sees a supply increase in Europe, \\nthe US & Canada, as well as Latin America, while other regions are either stable or decline \\nslightly. In the long-term, supply developments see increments coming from the Middle East \\nand Latin America, while most other regions witness a significant oil output decline. This \\nis one of the major drivers of long-term crude and condensate trade flows, which will be \\n discussed in more detail. \\nAs shown in Figure 6.2, between 2019 and 2025 the largest supply increments come from the US \\n& Canada, along with Latin America. In the US & Canada, supply is expected to recover after the \\n2020 drop. The increment between 2019 and 2025 is around 1.2 mb/d, mostly attributed to US tight \\noil. However, as the 2020 drop was more pronounced in the US & Canada, the increase between \\n2020 and 2025 is even more impressive Œ around 2.3 mb/d. \\nLatin America is expected to increase its crude and condensate supply by 1.1 mb/d between 2019 \\nand 2025, similar to the US & Canada. This includes new supply projects, primarily in Brazil and \\n219\\nGuyana. Europe is another region where oil supply growth is expected in the years to come. Rising \\ncrude and condensate output in Norway is the major reason for the increase in Europe™s supply of \\naround 0.6 mb/d for the period 2019Œ2025. \\nAt the same time, other regions are either stable, such as Africa and Russia & Caspian, between \\n2019 and 2025, or have lower supply in 2025, relative to 2019, such as the Asia-Pacific and Middle \\nEast. While a drop of some 0.5 mb/d (2019Œ2025) in the Asia-Pacific region is the result of natural \\ndecline, a similar drop in the Middle East is mostly the consequence of lower demand for OPEC \\ncrude in 2025, relative to 2019. Nevertheless, it needs to be emphasized that the Middle East is set \\nto increase its crude and condensate supply by around 1.5 mb/d between 2020 and 2025, following \\nstrong supply output reductions during 2020. \\nIn the long-term the situation changes fundamentally. Several regions show significant output \\ndeclines, including the US & Canada, along with Europe and the Asia-Pacific, mostly due to age\\n-ing production and natural decline. At the same time, these declines are expected to be offset by \\nsupply increases in the Middle East and Latin America. \\nIn more detail, the crude and condensate supply from the US & Canada is expected to decline \\nby around 3.8 mb/d between 2025 and 2045. This is accounted for by a decline in US supply after \\nit reaches a peak around 2027. Europe™s crude and condensate supply is projected to decline by \\nsome 1.5 mb/d from 2025Œ2045, in line with the natural decline from ageing fields in the UK and \\nNorway. In the Asia-Pacific region, crude and condensate supply continues its natural decline, \\nmostly in Indonesia, Malaysia and China. Overall supply from this is estimated to be around 2 mb/d \\nlower in 2045, relative to 2025. Moderate declines are also seen in the Russia & Caspian region, \\nwith output dropping by around 0.5 mb/d between 2025 and 2045. This is mostly due to declines \\nin Russia and Azerbaijan, which are not fully balanced by expected moderate supply increases in \\nKazakhstan over this period. \\nThe declines discussed above will be offset by rising production in the Middle East, mostly OPEC \\nMember Countries, where output is expected to rise by almost 5.5 mb/d in the 2025Œ2045 period. \\nAdditional volumes in the 2025Œ2045 timeframe will also come from Latin America (2 mb/d) and \\nAfrica (0.3 mb/d). \\n* Includes condensate and synthetic crudes.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.2\\nChange in crude and condensate supply* between 2019 and 2045\\nFigure 6.2\\nmboe/dŒ6Œ4Œ20246EuropeAfricaLatinAmericaUS &CanadaAsia-PacificMiddle EastRussia &Caspianmb/d2019Œ20252025Œ2045220\\nCrude and condensate oil movements\\nThe impacts of COVID-19 severely affected global oil demand and supply, as already described \\nin Chapters 3 and 4. Consequently, distortions in the global oil market massively impacted \\nthe global crude and condensate trade (Figure 6.3). Total crude and condensate exports fell \\nfrom around 38.2 mb/d in 2019 to below 34 mb/d in 2020. The largest reductions in exports \\nwere observed in the Middle East, Africa and the Russia & Caspian region, declining by around \\n 2.4 mb/d, 1.2 mb/d and 0.8 mb/d, respectively. This was in line with OPEC and non-OPEC vol\\n-untary production adjustments in the DoC. Exports from Latin America dropped only margin\\n-ally over the same time frame, by around 0.2 mb/d. For the same period, exports from the US \\n& Canada increased by around 0.2 mb/d, due to a strong demand decline and related supply \\n overhang in the US market.\\nFigure 6.4 shows global crude oil and condensate trade by major region and for anchor years, in \\nline with assumptions on oil demand and supply trends, as well as refining capacity development. \\nAfter the drop in 2020, crude and condensate trade is expected to recover by 2025, in line with \\ngrowing demand, and reach levels of just below 39 mb/d. Even though global demand continues to \\nincrease and several consuming regions see strong supply declines, global trade is set to stabilize \\nby 2030. The main reason for this is rising local crude and condensate consumption by large export\\n-ing regions, such as the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, which limits exports to some extent. \\nTotal crude and condensate exports are expected to reach almost 41 mb/d in 2040, in line with \\naforementioned supply trends, after which they are projected to settle at 40.3 mb/d by the end of \\nthe outlook period. \\nAs illustrated in Figure 6.5, the Middle East™s share of the global crude and condensate trade is \\nexpected to modestly decline from around 48% in 2019 to below 46% by 2025, as exports from \\nother regions rise and the Middle East increases local crude use. However, the share of Middle \\nEast crude and condensate in the average export barrel increases strongly beyond 2025 and \\nreaches 57% in 2045. \\nFigure 6.3\\nGlobal crude and condensate exports, 2015Œ2020*\\n* Includes exports from major exporting regions.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.3\\nmboe/d05101520201520162017201820192020mb/dUS & CanadaLatin AmericaAfricaRussia & CaspianMiddle East221\\nFigure 6.4\\nGlobal crude and condensate exports by origin*, 2019Œ2045\\n* Only trade between major regions is considered, intratrade is excluded.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.5\\nShare in crude and condensate exports, 2020Œ2045\\n* Others include Latin America, Africa, Russia & Caspian and the US & Canada. \\nSource: OPEC.\\nAt the same time, the share from other exporting regions, including Latin America, Africa, Russia \\n& Caspian, and the US & Canada, are set to decline or remain stable over the forecast period, \\npartly due to declining supply, but also due to rising local crude use in some regions. This conse\\n-quently limits the availability of crude and condensate from these areas for export markets. \\nFigures 6.6 to 6.10 show the main trends related to crude and condensate exports from the main \\nexporting regions Œ the Middle East, Russia & Caspian, Latin America, Africa and the US & Canada.\\nFigure 6.4\\nmboe/dRussia & CaspianAsia-PacificMiddle EastRussia & CaspianEuropeAfricaLatin AmericaUS & Canada0510152025303540452019202020252030203520402045mb/d Figure 6.5\\nmboe/d4042444648505254565860202020252030203520402045%Others*Middle East222Figure 6.6 shows crude and condensate exports from the Middle East. Total exports were seen at \\naround 18.5 mb/d in 2019, after which they declined to just above 16 mb/d in 2020. By 2025, crude \\nand condensate exports from the Middle East are likely to recover to 17.7 mb/d, which is slightly \\nlower compared with 2019. The major reason for this is that several other exporting regions increase \\ntheir exports, such as. Latin America, as well as the US & Canada. Another reason is an expected \\nrise in local crude use in the Middle East between 2019 and 2025, due to refining expansions. \\nBeyond 2025, Middle East crude and condensate exports are set to increase gradually, reaching \\nalmost 23 mb/d in 2045. The main export outlet for Middle East barrels is the Asia-Pacific, in line \\nwith rising demand and declining supply in the region. Export volumes to the Asia-Pacific are fore\\n-cast to increase from 15 mb/d in 2019 to above 19.5 mb/d in 2045, or around 85% of total Middle \\nEast exports in 2045. \\nOther regions remain important outlets for Middle East crude and condensate. The US & Canada \\nis expected to continue importing Middle East cargoes, around 1 mb/d in most of the anchor years, \\nin line with US refining sector requirements for heavier barrels. Europe will also continue import\\n-ing considerable volumes of Middle East crude, in line with declining European supply and despite \\nthe continent™s declining oil demand. After dropping to around 1 mb/d in 2025, exports to Europe \\nare estimated to recover to around 2 mb/d for the rest of the outlook period. \\nLocal crude use in the Middle East is set to rise continuously throughout the outlook period, from \\naround 7.2 mb/d in 2019 to above 10 mb/d in 2045. This is in line with rising domestic demand in \\nthe Middle East, along with rising product exports from the region. \\nCrude and condensate exports from Latin America are shown in Figure 6.7. After a marginal \\ndecline in 2020, they are set to increase strongly in the medium-term to almost 5 mb/d in 2025, \\nfrom 3.7 mb/d in 2019. Rising oil supply in several countries, such as Brazil and Guyana, combined \\nwith a limited increase in local crude use, is the main reason for this. \\nFigure 6.6\\nCrude and condensate exports from the Middle East by major destination, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.6\\nmboe/d05101520252019202020252030203520402045mb/dAsia-PacificEuropeAfricaLatin AmericaUS & CanadaMiddle East - local use223\\nThis year™s outlook for 2025 is somewhat lower compared with the WOO 2020 Reference Case, as \\noil supply growth in Latin America has been revised down due to a number of project postpone\\n-ments. In the long-term, crude and condensate exports are forecast to decline to levels of between \\n4 mb/d and 4.6 mb/d, as local crude use increases faster than crude and condensate supply. \\nAsia-Pacific and the US & Canada are the main destinations for Latin American barrels. US \\nrefiners (mostly Gulf Coast) are the traditional buyers of heavy oil from Latin America, which \\nis also favoured due to the relatively short distance between the two regions. Latin American \\nexports to the US & Canada are projected to increase to around 1.7 mb/d by 2025, from 1.4 mb/d \\nin 2019, and remain at that level to 2040. Towards the end of the outlook period, these volumes \\ndrop to around 1.4 mb/d once again, in line with lower demand and less refinery throughput in \\nthe US & Canada. \\nLatin American crude and condensate movements to the Asia-Pacific region are projected to \\nincrease to 3 mb/d in 2030, up from just below 2 mb/d in 2019, in line with rising output. However, \\nflows to the Asia-Pacific are forecast to start declining beyond 2030, reaching only 1.6 mb/d in \\n2040, due to higher local crude use in Latin America that limits export volumes. Finally in 2045, \\nvolumes increase again to around 2.8 mb/d as Latin American flows to other regions drops, such \\nas the US & Canada to the Asia-Pacific, as well as Europe. Although not the main destination, \\nLatin America is also expected to ship volumes to Europe throughout the outlook period. This \\nis estimated to be around 0.5 mb/d in most of the years modelled, dropping off at the end of the \\n outlook period as European refinery throughput declines. \\nLatin American local crude use is projected to increase from 3.6 mb/d in 2019 to 6.2 mb/d in \\n2045, as local oil demand increases. This is also in line with expected refinery new builds in Latin \\nAmerica of nearly 1 mb/d between 2021 and 2045 and the rising utilization of existing capaci\\n-ties. However, should an expected increase in local refinery throughputs not materialize for vari\\n-ous reasons, such as delays in refining new builds or lack of modernization of existing facilities, \\nFigure 6.7\\nCrude and condensate exports from Latin America by major destination, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.7\\nmboe/d012345672019202020252030203520402045mb/dAsia-PacicMiddle EastEuropeAfricaUS & CanadaLan America - local useAsia-PacificMiddle EastEuropeAfricaUS & CanadaLatin America - local use224\\nLatin America could see overall crude and condensate exports at higher levels. Consequently, this \\ncould increase product imports from other regions, such as the US & Canada, along with Europe. \\nCrude and condensate flows from the Russia & Caspian region (Figure 6.8) are expected to \\nrecover in the medium-term to levels around 6.8 mb/d, after experiencing a temporary drop to \\nalmost 6 mb/d in 2020. In the longer-term, total crude and condensate exports are forecast at \\nstable levels just below 7 mb/d, before dropping to around 6.5 mb/d in 2045. The relative stabil\\n-ity of crude and condensate exports is the result of declining crude and condensate output after \\n2030, which is offset by lower local crude use, especially in Russia. \\nEurope and the Asia-Pacific are the two major destinations for supplies from the Russia & \\nCaspian. Europe, which is a traditional market for barrels from the region, is projected to see \\nimports decline from around 4 mb/d in 2019 to below 3 mb/d in 2045. This is a consequence of \\ndeclining oil demand in Europe and lower refinery throughput, especially after 2035. The decline \\nin European exports is set to be compensated by rising movements of crude and condensate to the \\nAsia-Pacific. From around 2.6 mb/d in 2019, crude and condensate exports from Russia & Caspian \\nregion to the Asia-Pacific are expected to increase to more than 4 mb/d in 2040. This will lead to \\nhigh utilization of existing pipeline infrastructure, such as the ESPO pipeline with a total capacity \\nof 1.6 mb/d, as well as seaborne shipments. The OPEC Reference Case also assumes the possibil\\n-ity of further expansion of pipeline capacity to the Asia-Pacific in the long-term, which would help \\naccommodate the increase in exports. \\nAt the same time, local crude use is expected to decline gradually by almost 1 mb/d between 2019 \\nand 2045. This is mostly due to a demand decline in traditional export markets for refined prod\\n-ucts, such as Europe, in combination with rising competitive pressure from other refining centres, \\nsuch as the US and the Middle East.\\nAfrican crude and condensate exports dropped from almost 6 mb/d in 2019 to 4.7 mb/d in 2020 \\ndue to the COVID-19 demand decline and related supply adjustments. Shipments to Europe were \\nespecially affected during 2020. However, African crude and condensate exports (Figure 6.9) are \\nFigure 6.8\\nCrude and condensate exports from Russia & Caspian by major destination, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.8\\nAsia-PacificEuropeLatin AmericaMiddle EastUS & CanadaRussia & Caspian - local use01234567892019202020252030203520402045mb/d225\\nexpected to recover to around 5.3 mb/d in 2025, which will be followed by a gradual decline to the \\nend of the outlook period when levels are projected to reach 4.7 mb/d in 2045. This is mostly due \\nto the rising local use of crude in the long-term, which more than offsets the moderate increase \\nin African crude and condensate in the same period. \\nAfrican producers are expected to remain focused on two major export markets in the long-term \\nŒ Europe and the Asia-Pacific. Volumes heading to Europe are expected to increase to 2.8 mb/d \\nby 2030, thus replacing some of the losses in Europe™s domestic supply. Nevertheless, flows to \\nEurope are expected to decline to just above 2 mb/d by 2045, as European oil demand declines. \\nAt the same time, African crude and condensate exports to the Asia-Pacific see a gradual drop \\nfrom 2.6 mb/d in 2020 to 2.1 mb/d in 2040, in line with the lower availability of export barrels and \\na greater interest in trade with Europe due to lower transportation costs. In 2045, flows to the \\nAsia-Pacific recover to almost 2.5 mb/d, offsetting lower African exports to Europe. Africa contin\\n-ues exporting crude and condensate to the US & Canada, but these volumes remain minimal at \\n 0.2 mb/d throughout the outlook period. This is far away from the annual average levels of close \\nto 2 mb/d observed in 2010 before US tight oil supply surged. \\nGrowing local oil demand in Africa and an expected expansion of refining capacity in the medium- \\nand long-term is projected to lead to the higher local use of crude, which is set to rise from \\n 2.1 mb/d in 2019 to above 4 mb/d in 2045. However, any delays in the expansion of local refining \\ncapacity would result in higher crude and condensate availability for export and rising product \\nimports from other regions, such as the US & Canada, Europe, as well as the Middle East. \\nCrude and condensate exports from the US & Canada increased by around 0.2 mb/d in 2020, rela\\n-tive to 2019. The drop in supply was more than offset by the demand decline in 2020, which led to \\na somewhat higher availability of crude and condensate for export. \\nIn the medium-term, exports are set to increase, reaching 4 mb/d in 2025. This is in line with ris\\n-ing production, especially of US tight oil (see Chapter 4). However, as US oil supply peaks between \\nFigure 6.9\\nCrude and condensate exports from Africa by major destination, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.9\\nmboe/d012345672019202020252030203520402045mb/dAsia-PacificEuropeLatin AmericaMiddle EastUS & CanadaAfrica - local use226\\n2025 and 2030 and starts declining thereafter, crude and condensate exports from the US & \\nCanada are anticipated to drop, reaching around 3 mb/d in 2035 and then only 1.6 mb/d in 2045. \\nThe majority of exports from the US & Canada is accounted for by US light-sweet barrels, \\nwith minor volumes of other qualities from the Gulf of Mexico and Canada. Most of the bar\\n-rels are seen heading to the Asia-Pacific, peaking at around 2.8 mb/d in 2025, before gradually \\n declining to 1.3 mb/d by 2045.\\nExports to Europe are already expected to decline to around 0.5 mb/d in 2025, partly due to ris\\n-ing supply and declining demand in Europe. In the longer-term, US & Canada exports to Europe \\nare set to decline even further, hitting 0.2 mb/d in 2045. This is in line with weakening demand \\nand lower refinery throughput in Europe. US & Canada exports to Latin America are forecast to \\nincrease to 0.8 mb/d in 2025, from 0.2 mb/d in 2020, due to the higher availability of export bar\\n-rels and the preference of some Latin American customers for light-sweet cargoes. However, \\nshipments to Latin America are expected to decline gradually to just 0.1 mb/d in 2045, partly \\ndue to rising oil supply in Latin America, including the supply of relatively lighter grades with \\nlow sulphur content. \\nFigure 6.10\\nCrude and condensate exports from US & Canada by major destination, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLocal crude use in the US & Canada is expected to recover after the drop in 2020 to some \\n 13.6 mb/d, and reach levels close to 15 mb/d by 2030. However, declining oil demand in the \\nregion will result in lower local crude use, which is seen dropping to almost 13 mb/d by 2045.\\nAt the same time, the US & Canada is projected to continue importing crude (mostly the US), includ\\n-ing predominantly heavier grades from Latin America and the Middle East, which are well-suited \\nfor complex US refiners (Figure 6.11). Looking back, while US supply increased from 2010 onwards, \\ntotal crude and condensate imports dropped strongly. However, this decline affected mostly light \\nand medium grades, such as from Africa and the Middle East. At the same time, the share of heavy \\ngrades (below 25° API) in total US imports increased from around 40% in 2010 to more than 60% in \\n2020 as imported volumes were more stable. \\nFigure 6.10\\nmboe/d11.011.512.012.513.013.514.014.515.015.5local use (mb/d) 11.011.512.012.513.013.514.014.515.015.500.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.52019202020252030203520402045local use (mb/d) mb/dAsia-PacificEuropeLatin AmericaUS & Canada - local use227\\nThis trend is expected to continue in the future, with crude and condensate imports to the US & \\nCanada recovering after the drop in 2020, reaching almost 3.5 mb/d in 2025. However, with the \\nrising supply of Canadian heavy grades and declining US & Canada refinery throughput, crude \\nand condensate imports are expected to decline to between 2.2 mb/d and 2.6 mb/d for the rest \\nof the outlook period. \\nImports into the US & Canada are dominated by Latin American barrels, hovering between \\n 1.3 mb/d and 1.8 mb/d throughout the outlook period. At the same time, imports from the Middle \\nEast are projected to peak in 2025 at around 1.3 mb/d. Post-2025, imports from the Middle East \\nremain below 1 mb/d.

On one hand, this is the result of declining \\ndemand and on the other, trends in European supply with an increase of 0.6 mb/d between 2019 \\nand 2025 and then a gradual decline in the long-term. Long-term crude and condensate imports \\ndecline towards 7 mb/d in 2045 as demand drop more than offsets domestic supply declines. \\nEurope receives crude imports from all major exporting regions, dominated by the Russia \\n& Caspian, Africa and the Middle East. Minor imports from the US & Canada, as well as Latin \\nAmerica are also part of the import mix. Imports from Russia & Caspian are expected to decline \\nfrom around 4 mb/d in 2025 to below 3 mb/d in 2045, due to Europe™s declining demand and the \\nincreasing focus of the Russia & Caspian region on the Asia-Pacific. \\nAfrican volumes increase in the first half of the outlook period, reaching 2.8 mb/d in 2030, up from \\n2.4 mb/d in 2019. This is followed by a gradual decline to 2.1 mb/d, as they become increasingly \\nlimited due to local crude use. Middle East exports to Europe are expected to drop in the medium-\\nterm, reaching 1.1 mb/d in 2025, but are then projected to recover to between 1.7 mb/d and \\n 2.1 mb/d in the long-term, as exports from other regions decline. \\nAt the same time, US & Canada is expected to maintain exports to Europe at levels of around \\n 0.5 mb/d between 2025 and 2035, partly due to the balancing impact of Europe™s rising supply \\nFigure 6.11\\nCrude and condensate imports to the US & Canada by origin, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.11\\nmboe/dMiddle EastRussia & CaspianEuropeAfricaLatin America00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.02019202020252030203520402045mb/d 228\\nand declining demand in the medium-term. Europe™s imports of volumes from the US & Canada \\ndrop to around 0.2 mb/d by 2045, in line with the lower availability of exports and falling European \\ndemand. Latin American volumes are also seen occasionally going to Europe, however, they are \\nnot expected to break the 0.5 mb/d level in any of the projected anchor years. Towards the end of \\nthe outlook period, imports drop to almost zero, as demand in Europe declines.\\nFinally, the Asia-Pacific is set to remain the most important region in terms of crude and condensate \\nimports in the long-term. Overall import volumes are expected to increase from around 23.5 mb/d in \\n2019 (and 22 mb/d in 2020) to almost 30 mb/d by 2045. The Middle East remains the main supplier for \\nthe Asia-Pacific region. However, imports in the medium-term are stable at around 15 mb/d in 2025 \\nand 2030. This is due to rising imports from other regions such as the US & Canada, Latin America, \\nas well as Russia and the Caspian, along with the higher local use of crude in the Middle East. \\nIn the long-term, Middle Eastern flows to the Asia-Pacific region are set to increase to above \\n 19.5 mb/d by 2045, which is around 4.8 mb/d higher relative to levels seen in 2019. This is why \\nthe share of Middle Eastern imports to Asia-Pacific declines by 2030 to levels below 60%, before \\n rising again to 66% in 2045. \\nDue to rising oil production, Latin American imports become more important in the overall import \\nmix for the Asia-Pacific region. Crude and condensate flows are expected to increase from around \\n1.8 mb/d in 2019 and 2020 to almost 3 mb/d in 2030. Post-2030, these flows are set to decline tem\\n-porarily to 1.6 mb/d in 2040, but increase again in 2045, reaching 2.8 mb/d. The US & Canada also \\nincrease flows to the Asia-Pacific thanks to rising supplies, reaching 2.8 mb/d in 2025. \\nIn the longer-term, these volumes are expected to decline gradually, reaching 1.4 mb/d by 2045, \\nas US supply drops. With the increasing focus of the Russia & Caspian on the Asia-Pacific, flows \\nare set to increase from around 2.7 mb/d in 2019 and 2020 to above 4.1 mb/d in 2040. This is partly \\ncompensated by lower movements of crude and condensate to Europe. Flows from the Russia & \\nCaspian are projected to drop to around 3.7 mb/d in 2045, in line with the region™s declining sup\\n-ply. Finally, imports of African barrels to the Asia-Pacific remain strong and are estimated to be in \\nthe range of 2.1 mb/d to 2.4 mb/d throughout the outlook period. \\nFigure 6.12\\nCrude and condensate imports to Europe by origin, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.12\\nmboe/dMiddle EastRussia & CaspianUS & CanadaAfricaLatin America0246810122019202020252030203520402045mb/d 229\\nFigure 6.13\\nCrude and condensate imports to Asia-Pacific by origin, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.14 shows crude and condensate imports from all major regions for anchor years. Clear \\ntrends can be observed. The Middle East and Latin America have rising net crude and condensate \\nexports throughout the period, based on rising supply, especially in the Middle East in the latter part \\nof the outlook period. Middle East net exports increase from 18.3 mb/d to almost 23 mb/d in 2045. \\nOther export regions, such as Africa, are projected to see declining net exports, from 5.6 mb/d \\nin 2019 to below 4 mb/d in 2045, mostly due to the higher local use of crude as new refining \\nFigure 6.13\\nmboe/d051015202530352019202020252030203520402045mb/dMiddle EastRussia & CaspianUS & CanadaEuropeAfricaLatin AmericaFigure 6.14\\nRegional net crude and condensate imports, 2019, 2025, 2035 and 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.14\\nmboe/dOther Asia-PacificŒ25Œ20Œ1515Œ10Œ5051020mb/d2019202520352045US &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia &CaspianMiddleEastChinaOther Asia-Pacific230\\ncapacities are built and refining throughput increases (Chapter 5). Net exports from Russia & \\nCaspian are broadly stable for most of the outlook period at around 6.8 mb/d, but drop slightly by \\n2045 in line with declining supply. The US & Canada become net crude and condensate export\\n-ers in 2025 and 2035, with net crude exports of 0.7 mb/d), in line with higher exports relative to \\nrequired imports. However, this region becomes a net importer again by 2045 as oil supply and, \\nconsequently, exports decline below import levels. \\nEurope sees a gradual decline in net imports, which is primarily based on declining demand and \\npartly on rising domestic supply in the medium-term. Net crude and condensate imports to Europe \\nare sat to decline from 9.6 mb/d in 2019 to 7 mb/d in 2045. However, in the Other Asia-Pacific and \\nChina, there is a clear trend to rising net crude and condensate imports in line with rising demand \\nand declining domestic supplies. Overall, net crude and condensate imports into the region are \\nprojected to increase by more than 7 mb/d between 2019 and 2045, reaching 30 mb/d in 2045.\\n6.4 Product movements\\nRefined product movements between the seven major regions are significantly lower rela\\n-tive to crude and condensate flows. This is due to the preference of consuming countries to \\nincrease domestic refining and import crude and condensates, and benefit from lower trans\\n-portation costs for crude relative to refined products. The majority of refined products are \\nproduced and consumed within the respective regions. In other words, a large part of refined \\nproduct trade remains an intratrade issue (trade within the region itself). However, there are \\nstill significant refined product flows from regions with sufficient refining capacity to others \\nwhere local product demand is higher compared with local refinery production. Consequently, \\nfuture trends depend on local demand growth, as well as available and new refining capacity \\n(see Chapter 5). \\nThree regions are important net product exporters (Figure 6.15) Œ Russia & Caspian, the US \\n& Canada and the Middle East. Product net exports from Russia & Caspian are projected to \\nFigure 6.15\\nRegional net product imports, 2025, 2035 and 2045 \\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 6.15\\nmboe/dUS &CanadaLatinAmericaAfricaEuropeRussia & CaspianMiddleEastAsia-Pacific202520352045Œ6Œ4Œ20246810mb/d231\\ndecline moderately due to falling demand in Europe as the main export outlet, as well as rising \\n competition from other regions (the US & Canada and the Middle East). The Middle East is projected \\nto increase its net product exports by around 1 mb/d between 2025 and 2045, climbing to almost \\n 5 mb/d in 2045. This is the result of ongoing refining capacity expansion and efforts to replace \\ncrude and condensate exports by refined product flows. \\nIn the US & Canada, an expected decline in domestic demand will lead to a rising focus by US \\nrefiners on export markets. At the same time, the local availability of crude and condensate pro\\n-vides additional support for refined product exports. This Outlook assumes that US refiners, pre\\n-dominantly highly complex, world-class refineries, will be competitive in the international refined \\nproduct market in the long-term. Consequently, net product exports from the US & Canada are \\nprojected to increase from just below 2 mb/d in 2025 to 4.2 mb/d in 2045. \\nOn the net import side, the Asia-Pacific sees a significant increase from around 5 mb/d in 2025 \\nto 8.7 mb/d by 2045. This is due to an increase in demand, which is higher than the expan\\n-sion of the region™s refining capacity. Latin America is projected to reduce its product imports \\nfrom around 2.1 mb/d in 2025 to 1.6 mb/d in 2045, as local refinery capacity expands and local \\nrefinery throughput increases. In Africa, a marginal increase in product net imports is pro\\n-jected as expanding refining capacity will not be sufficient to offset the increase in demand. For \\nboth Latin America and Africa, any delay in the expansion of refining capacity would necessarily \\nlead to increasing product imports, predominantly from the US & Canada, the Middle East and \\n possibly Europe. \\nFinally, Europe seems largely balanced between 2025 and 2045, although marginal changes are \\nprojected. From being a marginal net importer in 2025, Europe becomes a net exporter towards \\nthe end of the outlook period, mostly due to declining oil demand and a decreasing need for \\n product imports. \\n232\\nEnergy policy, climate change and\\nsustainable development\\n233\\nKey takeaways\\nŁ There is growing awareness among policymakers in many countries that there is a need \\nto accelerate actions addressing climate change, resulting in ambitious new policy tar\\n-gets. At the same time, there is increased public acceptance of products and services \\nwith a lower environmental footprint, and a state of technology development that offers \\nsolutions, albeit at a cost. \\nŁ In 2020, Parties to the Paris Agreement were expected to announce their new or updated \\nNDCs aimed at achieving the agreement™s long-term goals. Due to COVID-19, not all \\ncountries have done so. \\nŁ An assessment of the collective efforts in already submitted NDCs shows that the\\n estimated emission reductions from their implementation fall short of what is required \\nto achieve a temperature target of well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.\\nŁ To enable enhanced global efforts to tackle climate change, decision making should be \\nmade in a manner that is both inclusive and fair. It should facilitate consensus-based \\ndecisions, providing space to both developed and developing countries, and take into \\naccount the principles of the Convention and the Paris Agreement.\\nŁ The fulfilment of developed countries™ commitments on critical issues such as climate \\nfinance, technology transfer and capacity-building in developing countries is required for \\nall countries to be able to enhance their mitigation action and reduce vulnerability to the \\nharmful effects of climate change. As there is a vast gap between the support required \\nand support provided, climate finance, in particular, should be scaled up and take into \\naccount funding requirements for both mitigation and adaptation.\\nŁ The eradication of energy poverty could enable the achievement of many other SDGs, \\nincluding those related to climate action. The rate of advancement remains below the \\nlevels required to achieve universal energy access by 2030. \\nŁ Over the period 2010Œ2019, important progress has been made in South Asia, yet \\n population growth has resulted in an increased number of people without access to \\n electricity and clean cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa.\\nŁ Hydrogen could play an important role in efforts to reduce future emissions. Hence, many \\ncountries increasingly focus on hydrogen as an integral part of their energy policies.\\nŁ The EU, Japan, South Korea, the US and India have specific programmes for hydro\\n-gen development. China is one the few large countries that has so far not announced a \\n separate hydrogen strategy.\\nŁ The Middle East region and Africa are also moving towards putting in place hydrogen \\nenabling policies. 234\\nChange takes time, especially when it is a fundamental and global change. This is evidently true of \\nthe energy sector, which has undergone various structural changes in the past. One of these large \\ntransitions obviously lies ahead and there are several factors that will likely make this energy \\ntransition different from those of the past. \\nAt the highest level, there is growing awareness among policymakers in many countries that there \\nis a need to accelerate actions addressing climate change, which have recently resulted in ambi\\n-tious new policy targets. At the same time, there is increased public acceptance of products and \\nservices with a lower environmental footprint, and a state of technology development that offers \\nsolutions, albeit at a cost. These trends are also being observed at a time when COVID-19 recov\\n-ery plans in some major economies provide significant sources of funding that aim to support the \\nbuilding of more resilient and sustainable economies.\\nAt the forefront is an evolution of energy policies that move towards achieving the goals of \\nthe Paris Agreement. Several economic powerhouses Œ including the EU, the US, Japan, UK, \\nCanada and Brazil Œ have recently announced their intention to reach net-zero emissions by \\n2050, with China targeting carbon-neutral growth by 2060. At the same time, negotiations at the \\n international level are intensifying in order to achieve the overarching global goals.\\nIt is the pace of change that is critical in the impending energy transition. For targets to be met \\nby the middle of this century, the rate of climate mitigation action needs to accelerate and many \\ncountries have put in place new policy measures and strengthened existing ones to do just that. \\nThis chapter explores the key energy policies of major economies that will have an impact on the \\nenergy sector and, therefore, the future energy mix. The use of hydrogen, which could play an \\nimportant role in the energy mix in the long-term, is also highlighted. \\nIn addition, the chapter includes a standalone section on the latest developments in regard to \\nUN processes on climate change and the implementation of the Paris Agreement in the context \\nof sustainable development. This analysis focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on formal climate \\nnegotiations, briefly presenting the key findings in assessing countries™ commitments for tackling \\nclimate change. Moreover, the analysis provides insights on progress made towards eradicating \\nenergy poverty and efforts to build inclusive, resilient and sustainable societies through universal \\nenergy access.\\n7.1 Climate change action and sustainable development\\nThe Paris Agreement, under the auspices of the UNFCCC, as well as the UN 2030 Agenda for \\nSustainable Development, are the two landmark global action plans adopted in 2015 to enhance \\ncollective efforts aimed at reducing global GHG emissions, increasing adaptation capacity and \\nadvancing progress towards economic, social and environmental sustainability.\\nThe year 2020 was considered critical for the implementation of both the Paris Agreement and \\nthe 2030 Agenda. It was seen as key to addressing the global challenge of climate change in the \\npost-2020 period and in pursuing progress toward achieving the SDGs. In regard to the UN climate \\n process specifically:\\nŁ UNFCCC Parties were expected to fulfil and deliver their pre-2020 climate mitigation, \\nadaptation and support commitments, in accordance with the principles and provisions of \\nthe Convention;\\nŁ Parties to the Paris Agreement were expected to submit their new or updated NDCs prior \\nto the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), communicating ambitious efforts in line \\nwith the long-term temperature target of the agreement, and demonstrating a successive \\nprogression within this five-year NDC cycle; and\\n235\\nŁ Parties were also expected to make critical decisions at COP26 and resolve outstanding \\nnegotiation issues related to the Paris Agreement Work Programme (PAWP), including \\nsubstantive matters on finance, transparency and cooperative approaches.\\nMoreover, the 2020 UN High-level Political Forum (HLPF) on Sustainable Development, which is \\nthe core platform for reviewing the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs, was originally intended to initi\\n-ate a new four-year cycle to review the implementation of the SDGs and assess progress towards \\nachieving the 2030 Agenda.\\nYet since early 2020, the world has been confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has \\nbrought widespread human and socio-economic ramifications. The pandemic has affected the \\nUN processes on climate change and sustainable development too, with implications on the \\n implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda, as further elaborated on below.\\n7.1.1 UN climate process and the Paris Agreement implementation\\nDue to the pandemic, it was noted that formal negotiation sessions on climate change would only \\nresume when in-person sessions reconvene. As a result, both COP26 and the sessions of the \\nUNFCCC subsidiary bodies (SB52) in 2020 were postponed. \\nIt led to climate diplomacy moving to informal discussions and they have been held in virtual mode \\never since. Instead of the UNFCCC formal meetings, two web-based climate dialogues were held \\nin June and November 2020, and in May and June 2021, the first part of the SB sessions were con\\n-vened in an informal virtual setting, aimed at addressing mandated work from 2020 and 2021, yet \\nwithout making any decisions.Official negotiations are, therefore, on hold until in-person sessions are possible. In-person delib\\n-erations would allow full, effective and inclusive engagement of both developed and developing \\ncountries, leaving no issue and no one behind. Following a decision to start a day earlier than orig\\n-inally planned, COP26 is currently scheduled to take place from 31 October to 12 November 2021, \\nin Glasgow, UK. However, travel restrictions and guidelines, including having to quarantine, raise \\nuncertainties on the format of the climate change conference and whether standard procedures \\nof the UNFCCC can be observed.\\nIt should also be noted that climate diplomacy is a multifaceted and dynamic issue. UN climate \\nchange negotiations require a significant amount of Parties™ engagement on a wide range of com\\n-plex technical issues that could lead to the full operationalization of the Paris Agreement and an \\neffective global response to the challenge of climate change in the context of sustainable devel\\n-opment and poverty eradication. Thus, intense negotiations are expected, which will likely ensure \\nthat the time lost is made up in advancing work, leading to a successful COP26 outcome.\\nBesides advancing technical work, leadership and political decisions would be required that \\nwould allow outstanding issues related to the Paris Agreement rulebook to be resolved. A signifi\\n-cant amount of work remains to be done, and the COP26 Presidency (the UK) continues to reach \\nout to Parties, creating space that could lead to potential compromises. For instance, the COP26 \\nPresident hosted a ministerial meeting with Parties from key negotiation groups in July 2021, \\nfocusing on issues related to market and non-market approaches, adaptation and finance, among \\nothers.\\nThe May-June SB sessions, held for the first time virtually, aimed to allow Parties to make pro\\n-gress on the high volume of work accumulated in the absence of negotiation sessions in 2020. \\nConsultations were informal and convened for the purpose of discussion. Despite a number of \\ntechnical challenges for both developed and developing countries, particularly holding the ses\\n-sions in three different time zones, Parties remained committed to discuss critical issues. The \\n236\\nprogress achieved during these sessions was captured in informal papers, with some countries \\nstressing the need for additional informal consultations prior to COP26.\\nRegardless of the impact of COVID-19 on UNFCCC processes, the outstanding negotiation issues \\nshould be resolved with all Parties agreeing upon a comprehensive, balanced, Party-driven and \\nconsensus-based outcome. This includes adopting decisions that are guided by the objectives of \\nthe Convention and the Paris Agreement, taking into account the principles of equity, common but \\ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, and in light of national circumstances.\\nMoreover, the pre-2020 implementation gap that has been assessed, including support provided \\nby developed countries to developing countries with the provision of finance, technology transfer \\nand capacity-building, should be addressed. The fulfilment of developed countries™ commitments \\non critical issues such as climate finance would be required for all countries to be able to enhance \\ntheir mitigation action and reduce vulnerability to the harmful effects of climate change.\\nA number of developed countries have reiterated their commitment to the goal of mobilizing jointly \\n$100 billion p.a. from different sources by 2020. Some have referred to the crucial role of public \\nfinance in meeting the climate investment needs and priorities of developing countries, while \\nalso unlocking finance at the scale required for achieving the Paris Agreement goals. Yet pre-\\n2020 commitments were inadequate. Climate finance has increased, reaching an annual average \\nof $48.7 billion in 2017Œ2018, but it remains far lower than developed countries™ commitment to \\nmobilize $100 billion annually by 2020.\\nFor developing countries, implementing a low-emission, climate-resilient development \\n strategy means attracting and securing financial and technological support to help increase \\ncapacity-building. COVID-19 has impacted developing countries™ access to funding for climate \\naction. The majority of climate-related financial support is also targeted to mitigation action. \\nThere is, therefore, a need to enhance adaptation support. Climate finance should be new, addi\\n-tional, adequate and predictable, ensuring a balance between support for mitigation and for \\n adaptation in developing countries.\\nTechnology transfer and capacity-building are needed too. It is estimated that about 85% of the \\npopulation in Europe and North America uses the Internet, but only 20% are connected in the \\nleast developed countries. Developing countries face several challenges when engaging in virtual \\nUN sessions, including those on matters related to climate change and sustainable development. \\nPoor quality Internet connections, inadequate equipment and a lack of IT infrastructure, com\\n-pounded by different time zones, impede their effective participation. It is, therefore, necessary to \\naddress the technical and organizational challenges they face when engaging in virtual meetings. \\nCollective efforts to address climate change require leadership and proactive engagement from \\nall countries in the UNFCCC™s consensus-based decision-making process.\\nMoreover, the pandemic has impacted developing countries™ ability to develop strategies, policies \\nand plans that support climate mitigation and adaptation action. Capacity-building Œ including in \\nthe energy sector Œ is critical, through integrating climate change and support action to reduce \\nemissions, adapting to its negative consequences, and eliminating the impacts of the implemen\\n-tation of response measures.\\nOn post-2020 climate action, the collective progress toward the Paris Agreement™s goal has been \\nassessed by the UNFCCC Secretariat, based on Parties™ NDCs submitted by the end of 2020. This \\nanalysis concludes that some Parties have strengthened their commitment to reducing or limit\\n-ing GHG emissions by 2025 and/or 2030, demonstrating increased ambition to address climate \\nchange. Parties have increased the coverage of sectors and GHGs, but while the COVID-19 pan\\n-demic was mentioned by many Parties, most of them have not reflected its potential impacts in \\ntheir NDCs.237\\nFigure 7.1\\nElements of Parties™ new or updated NDCs\\n* LULUCF stands for land use, land-use change and forestry.\\nSource: UNFCCC Secretariat, 2021.Figure 7.1\\nmboe/d89%85%76%39%79%84%77%84%Energy supplyTransportBuildingsIndustryAgricultureLULUCF*WasteCross-cutting/otherShare of Parties referring to specific priority areas in their NDCs47%22%20%45%66%54%FinanceTechnologyCapacity-buildingInformation on means of implementation in NDCsIncluded in other sections of NDCIncluded in dedicated sectionIt is further stressed that submitted NDCs cover the energy sector. Almost all Parties outline \\nnational mitigation measures as key instruments for achieving emission reduction targets in \\nspecific priority areas, including energy supply, transport, buildings and industry (Figure 7.1). \\nNational mitigation measures for renewable energy generation are most frequently mentioned by \\nParties, followed by measures for energy efficiency improvement. In order to reduce the carbon \\nintensity of electricity and other fuels, Parties consider shifting to low- or zero-carbon fuels, as \\nwell as to increased electrification of the supply and end-use of energy. To reduce energy demand, \\noptions such as improving energy efficiency and shifting to more efficient modes of transport are \\nmentioned.Compared to the previous NDCs, more Parties report in their new or updated NDCs on mitigation \\nco-benefits of adaptation action and economic diversification plans. Therefore, more Parties pro\\n-vide information on their consideration of the socio-economic impacts of the implementation of \\nclimate mitigation response measures, including on just transition and economic diversification. \\nBesides increasing the share of renewable sources in energy generation and improving energy \\nefficiency, the critical role of technologies such as CCS, fuel switching and the enhanced use of \\nthe circular economy are highlighted.\\nAlmost all Parties also refer to the means of implementation in their NDCs, with some including \\ndedicated sections on finance, technology and/or capacity-building, and even providing quanti\\n-tative estimates of financial support needs for NDC-implementation. Specific technology needs \\nrelate to the areas of energy, industry, infrastructure and buildings, as well as transport, among \\nothers. Identified areas include capacity-building needs for formulating policy; integrating mit\\n-igation and adaptation into sectoral planning processes; accessing finance; and the need for \\n international cooperation.\\nMore importantly, it is to be highlighted that the estimated emission reductions resulting from \\nNDC-implementation fall far short of what is required, indicating the need for Parties to further \\n238\\nstrengthen their mitigation commitments under the Paris Agreement (Figure 7.2). At the \\ntime of writing, major economies such as China and India had not submitted their new or \\nupdated NDCs. More Parties are expected to communicate these prior to COP26. The UNFCCC \\nSecretariat set a deadline of 30 July 2021 for collectively assessing submissions to the updated \\nversion of its synthesis report that is expected to be considered in Glasgow.\\nFigure 7.2\\nEmissions gap, 2030\\nNote: The grey area presents an upper/lower range of a 2°C-consistent pathway.\\nSource: Copyright Climate Action Tracker, Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute.\\nFigure 7.2\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n202530354045505560199019952000200520102015202020252030Gt CO2eqRangeHistoricalPledges &Targets (High)Pledges &Targets (Low)2°C consistentSome Parties have developed their new or updated NDCs, along with their long-term strategies, \\nconsidering their climate action in the context of socio-economic recovery from the pandemic. \\nIt should be noted that the world initially experienced a reduction in emissions due to national \\nlockdowns and travel restrictions in 2020. Yet as restrictions were eased, emission levels began \\nto rise and preliminary data shows that global GHG emissions increased in 2020 on an annual \\nbasis.At the same time, there is growing momentum from countries to set ‚net-zero emissions™, ‚carbon \\nneutrality™ or ‚climate neutrality™ targets, to be achieved by 2050 or 2060. Figure 7.3 shows that as \\nof June 2021, 92 Parties representing more than 42% of global GHG emissions had submitted their \\nnew or updated NDCs. Moreover, a total of five countries had enacted ‚net-zero™ legislation, and 26 \\nhad included ‚net-zero™ goals in policy documents.\\nThus, it remains to be seen whether and how countries will fulfil their pledges, implementing \\nmitigation and adaptation action in the context of sustainable development. The Paris Agreement \\ncalls on Parties to undertake collective participation in tackling climate change, recognizing the \\ndifferentiation between countries™ responsibilities for emission reductions in light of national \\ncircumstances. Innovative solutions such as the CCE could provide an integrated approach for \\nemissions management and reduction to support sustainable energy systems and respond to \\nclimate targets (see Box 7.1). Global cooperation, international solidarity and enhanced engage\\n-ment are also required, ensuring the provision of the means of implementation to developing \\ncountries.\\n239\\nFigure 7.3\\nStatus of Parties™ NDCs and ‚net-zero™ announcements\\nNote: NZT stands for ‚net-zero™ target.Source: Climate Watch NDC Content & Net-Zero Tracker. 2020.

They are a continuation of the Kingdom™s efforts \\nto tackle climate change during its G20 Presidency in 2020, which resulted in a declaration \\non the environment and the adoption of the concept of a CCE.\\nAcknowledging the need to reduce GHG emissions, the G20 Energy Ministers endorsed the \\nCCE Platform with its 4Rs framework (reduce, reuse, recycle and remove), proposed by the \\nKingdom (Figure 1).\\nThe CCE is a voluntary, holistic, integrated, inclusive, pragmatic and complementary \\napproach towards more comprehensive, resilient, sustainable and climate-friendly energy \\nsystems that support and enable sustainable development, ensuring energy access and \\nFigure 1\\nThe circular carbon economy\\n1Enhanced Oil Recovery.\\nSource: Ministry of Energy, Saudi Arabia.\\nBox F1\\nThe carbon circular economy\\nCOFrom a linear carbon economyproduction of CO and GHGs asby-products...to a circular carbon economy (4Rs)EnergyefficiencyRenewableenergyLow carbonfuelsProduceCombustProduceCombustCaptureReuseRecycleRemoveCO  and GHGswithoutas chemicalalterationCO  and GHGsthrough chemicalalterationCO  and GHGsthat are already producedDirect aircaptureMineralizationand storageNature basedsolutionsCarbon topolymers/chemicalsCarbonto fuelsCarbon to othermaterialsFood andbeveragesSupercriticalCOEOR122222CO22 Reduce241\\nFinally, the following should be highlighted on issues related to the UN climate process. First, \\nthe US officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement on 4 November 2020 and formally re-joined \\non 19 February 2021, as further explained in a later section of this chapter. Moreover, as of \\n 28 October 2020, the threshold for entry into force of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto \\nProtocol was achieved, since 147 countries have deposited their instrument of acceptance. The \\n amendment entered into force on 31 December 2020.\\n7.1.2 Progress towards eradicating energy poverty\\nWith regard to the 2030 Agenda, national priorities have shifted towards the fight against the \\nCOVID-19 pandemic. As indicated in the latest report of the UN Secretary-General on progress \\ntowards the SDGs, the pandemic has exacerbated inequalities, and the extreme global poverty \\nrate rose in 2020 for the first time in over 20 years. All countries have been impacted, but the \\nworld™s poorest and vulnerable have been the most affected, with debt distress occurring in many \\ndeveloping countries. In addition, the means of implementation required to achieve the SDGs, \\nincluding financial flows, have been negatively affected by the pandemic.\\nConcurrently, the agenda of the 2020 session of the HLPF was adjusted to focus on the impacts \\nof the pandemic on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and its SDGs. Moreover, the theme of \\nthe 2021 HLPF was ‚Sustainable and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic that promotes the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development: building an inclusive and effective path for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda in the context of the decade of action and  delivery for sustainable development\\n™. Both sessions were convened virtually, using a hybrid \\napproach (namely, in-person and virtual participation) only for the high-level segment of Economic \\nand Social Council (ECOSOC) and the ministerial segment of the Forum.\\nA key takeaway message from these sessions was the need to enhance global efforts for building \\nresilient and sustainable societies. International cooperation and solidarity are more important \\nthan ever, whereas the central principle of the 2030 Agenda Œ to leave no one behind Œ must be \\nkept at the heart of efforts toward achieving all SDGs.\\nRecognizing that energy is inextricably linked to climate change and many other SDGs, and has a \\nvital role to play in COVID-19 recovery efforts, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) has also mandated \\nenhancing climate action. The CCE framework encourages countries to use all technolo\\n-gies, forms of energy and mitigation opportunities, in light of resource availability, capaci\\n-ties and national circumstances.\\nIn the CCE, the 4Rs help to develop a strategy for managing carbon. The amount of carbon \\nthat needs to be managed is reduced using energy resources that do not emit carbon (e.g. \\nnuclear power) as well as energy efficiency measures. Biomass resources, such as trees \\nand plants recycle carbon by drawing it from the atmosphere. These resources also derive \\nbioenergy, whereas carbon capture and direct air capture (DAC) technologies can remove \\ncarbon from the atmosphere. Moreover, carbon can be reused and converted to feedstock \\nfor chemicals, concrete and other building aggregates, or even fuels.\\nOverall, the CCE offers an approach to address climate challenges, while contributing to sus\\n-tainable development and economic diversification. It utilizes all available levers to address \\nemissions while generating value. Focusing on energy and emissions, it takes a holistic \\nview on emissions reduction technologies, recognizing the economic value of carbon and \\n emphasizing the diversity of national circumstances.\\n242\\nthe UN Secretary-General to convene a High-Level Dialogue on Energy during the 76th UNGA ses\\n-sion in September 2021. This is the first summit-level event on energy since the UN Conference on \\nNew and Renewable Sources of Energy held in 1981, in Nairobi, Kenya.\\nThe event will aim to promote the implementation of the energy-related goals and targets of the \\n2030 Agenda and support the implementation of the Paris Agreement. It will address five themes \\nthat focus on the energy transition; energy access; enabling the SDGs through inclusive, just \\nenergy transitions; finance and investment; and innovation, technology and data.\\nBased on the latest available data, the world is still short of achieving universal energy access. \\nEradication of energy poverty should, therefore, remain an overarching goal for resilient and sus\\n-tainable development. As prescribed by SDG7, the provision of universal access to affordable, reli\\n-able, sustainable and modern energy is a key enabler for every aspect of sustainable development. \\nA multiplier effect of achieving SDG7 exists for all other SDGs, including the eradication of pov\\n-erty, improved health, education, tackling climate change, and overall well-being and prosperity.\\nIn the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems are still struggling to effectively \\nmanage this global crisis. Hundreds of millions remain confined to their homes, and for those with\\n-out access to electricity or the Internet this causes major challenges for issues such as working, \\nshopping and education, and the challenges are further exacerbated if there is an absence of clean \\ncooking fuels. Additionally, increasing household electricity requirements is adding risks to the reli\\n-ability of creaking electricity grids. The pandemic has revealed significant inequalities in access to \\nreliable energy and healthcare. \\nIt has become evident that energy access is essential to help populations mitigate the effects of, \\nand recover from the impacts of the pandemic and health crisis. As already highlighted, energy \\naccess is needed to power healthcare facilities Œ including for vaccine deployment and storage, \\nsupplying clean water for hygiene, and enabling communications and IT services, among others.\\nFigure 7.4 shows that the global electricity access rate increased from 83% in 2010 to 90% in \\n2019. Despite this progress in access to electricity over the last decade, however, approximately \\nFigure 7.4\\nPopulation without electricity and share of population with electricity access\\n Source: World Bank, 2021.\\nFigure 7.4\\nmboe/d0102030405060708090100010203040506070809010002004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,8002,00020002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016201720182019%millionWorldCentral & Southern AsiaSub-Saharan Africa243\\n759 million people remain unserved in 2019, with about 19% of them in Asia and 79% in Africa. \\nAccording to UN reports launched at the ministerial thematic forums, which were held in June \\n2021 in preparation for the High-level Dialogue on Energy, progress must be accelerated to \\nachieve universal energy access. The electricity access rate needs to increase by 2 pp on an \\nannual basis to achieve 100% global access by 2020; with current trends and expected popula\\n-tion growth only around 92% of the global population will have electricity in 2030. Moreover, the \\npandemic is expected to impede progress in future electrification.\\nIn general, the total number of people who lack access to electricity has declined by around 34% \\nfrom 1.15 billion in 2010 to 759 million in 2019 (Figure 7.5). Over the 2010Œ2019 period, impor\\n-tant progress has been made in South Asia, particularly in India, yet only 46% of the population \\nin Sub-Saharan Africa is currently electrified. Population growth has resulted in an increased \\nnumber of people lacking access to electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa. About 28% of healthcare \\nfacilities and only one-third of schools in the sub-continent have reliable electricity.\\nFigure 7.5\\nGlobal access to electricity\\nSource: World Bank, 2021.\\nFigure 7.5\\n37325565709140440103301402004006008001,0001,2001,40020102019millionWorldPopulation withoutelectricity access by regionChanges in populationwithout access, 2010Œ2019Rest of the WorldSub-Saharan Africa14Œ5Œ337Œ394Œ51Œ16Western Asia & Northern AfricaEastern & South-Eastern AsiaCentral & Southern AsiaIn addition, it is estimated that during the pandemic, basic electricity services have become \\nunaffordable for up to 30 million people in Africa who had previously enjoyed access. Thus, \\nthe number of people without electricity access in Africa is likely to be even higher in 2020. \\nIt means that in the period up to 2030, efforts to eradicate energy poverty in Africa should be \\nsubstantially enhanced on an annual basis to close the access gap.\\nAt the same time, access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking has been stagnant. Clean \\nfuels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) include LPG, ethanol, biogas, \\nsolar cookers and electricity. In 2019, approximately 34% of the global population, or 2.6 bil\\n-lion people, lacked access to clean cooking fuels and technologies (Figure 7.6). More than \\n70% of Africans lack access to clean cooking fuels and technologies, and are thus exposed \\nto high levels of household air pollution, with serious health implications that increase their \\n vulnerability to diseases such as COVID-19.\\n244\\nOver the period 2010Œ2019, the number of people who had to rely on wood, coal, charcoal and \\nanimal waste for cooking declined by 9%, from approximately three billion to 2.6 billion at a \\nglobal level.

Yet the num\\n-ber of people without access in Africa has increased from around 793 million to 963 million people.\\nThe access deficit between urban and rural areas at a global level has dropped since 2010. \\nHowever, population growth continues to outpace the annual increase in the number of people \\ngaining access to clean cooking in Sub-Saharan Africa. With its access deficit having increased by \\nalmost 20% since 2010, Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for more than 35% of the global population \\nthat had no access to clean cooking in 2019. Considering different regional trends, it is expected \\nthat about 28% of the global population may still be without access to clean cooking fuels by 2030. \\nThus, the clean cooking access rate needs to increase by 3 pp on an annual basis to fully address \\nthis challenge by the end of this decade.\\nTo tackle this challenge, electrification could support efforts for the enhanced use of clean cooking \\nfuels and technologies. The pandemic, however, has caused both supply and demand shocks in the \\nenergy sector. If economic conditions weaken it can make it harder for low-income households and \\nsmall companies to pay their electricity bill, which can lead to disconnection. Moreover, nascent com\\n-panies operating mini-grids in rural locations and providing off-grid solar services to an increasing \\nshare of the African population could face financial hardship and even insolvency due to the pandemic.\\nOverall, discrepancies prevail both between and within countries, and exposes a significant divide \\nbetween urban and rural regions. Affordability for the poor and rural communities has been ham\\n-pered due to the economic downturn. Finance for energy access has not reached the level required \\nto eliminate the access gap by 2030. In fact, international financial flows, particularly in support of \\nmodern energy to developing countries, has actually declined in recent years, although it remains \\nhigher than in 2010.Energy poverty remains a challenge for developed regions too. In the EU, for example, it is \\nestimated that currently almost 7% of the population cannot afford to heat their homes suffi\\n-ciently. Globally, a significant number of grid-connected customers experience unreliable ser\\n-vice. Increasing fiscal constraints post-COVID could hinder a rapid expansion of reliable grid-\\n connected electricity access.\\nIn light of the above, it is essential to maintain momentum for building back better, inclusive, \\nresilient and sustainable societies. Key to achieving this is providing access to electricity and other \\nmodern energy sources, promoting clean cooking solutions, supporting the poorest and most vul\\n-nerable energy consumers and ensuring energy access for health services. It is also important \\nto align the cost, reliability, quality and affordability of energy services, within a policy framework \\nthat does not discriminate against any energy source and ensures that no one is left behind.\\nInternational cooperation and global partnerships could play a pivotal role so that all countries, espe\\n-cially developing countries, can address the compounding and parallel health, economic and environ\\n-mental crises. Achieving universal energy access should also be an integral part of a just and inclusive \\nenergy transition that is not a one-size-fits-all process and takes into account national priorities, capa\\n-bilities and circumstances. The provision of financial support and technology transfer are enabling \\n factors for enhancing efforts to promote energy access, particularly in developing countries.\\n7.2 Energy policies of major economies\\n7.2.1 USPolicy measures and the priorities of the US government can vary significantly between adminis\\n-trations and the new Biden administration is no exception, especially in the realm of energy poli\\n-cies. President Biden has very quickly put climate change at the front and centre, to be considered \\non par with other top issues of the government. \\n246\\nOne of President Biden™s first executive orders set the US on the path to formally re-join the Paris \\nAgreement on 19 February 2021. Others provided a variety of instructions to parts of the govern\\n-ment to undertake actions related to climate change, including an instruction to review the regu\\n-lations and actions undertaken in the previous four years, ultimately to reverse and undo many of \\nthe Trump administration™s actions. \\nIn another contrast to the previous administration, Biden sought to return the US to the world \\nstage of climate change diplomacy and in April 2021 hosted a Leaders™ Summit on climate, which \\nsaw new announcements from a number of countries to tackle climate change. The US also \\n submitted its NDC after re-joining the Paris Agreement.\\nWhile aspects of the US-China relationship remain challenging, climate change is one area that could \\nfacilitate closer relations between the two countries. It should be noted, however, that the broad \\ntrade tariffs are unlikely to be undone by the current administration. This is important when push\\n-ing for rapid increases in renewable energy use as the impact of tariffs on supply chains that support \\nrenewable energy Œ such as solar panels, batteries and other components Œ is a major challenge.\\nClimate policy\\nIn terms of the country™s high-level targets, the US has announced the goal to reach net-zero \\nemissions by 2050 and, as laid out in its NDC, it aims for a reduction in emissions of 50Œ52% by \\n2030, from 2005 levels. Additionally, the US targets having a carbon-free electricity sector by 2035. \\nThis bold target would require a major ramp up of renewable sources in the energy mix, even at \\nthe expense of natural gas, which has been a transition fuel towards lower-emission sources of \\nelectricity generation for many countries. \\nThe Biden administration will look to make the 2050 target legally binding. However, even with \\ncontrol of both houses of Congress there is no guarantee such legislation would be passed, or \\nfor that matter, other legislation in support of the administration™s major ambitions. As well as \\nlegislative means, policy changes will also be sought through regulatory measures, for instance, \\nthrough the EPA, and the toughening of efficiency standards. In contrast to other major regions, \\nsuch as the EU and China, it is unlikely that the US will pursue a national carbon tax.\\nIn general, the new government will have to put significant efforts into ensuring that policy \\nchanges can survive likely court challenges, a lesson learned from the Obama presidency when a \\nSupreme Court ruling meant the Clean Power Plan never took effect. \\nEnergy policy\\nAmong the Biden administration™s actions on its first day was the revocation of a permit for the \\nKeystone XL oil pipeline between Nebraska and Alberta, Canada. This doomed the project that had \\nbeen blocked and then restarted under the previous two administrations. Additionally, a morato\\n-rium on drilling on federal lands has been put in place, but this will not necessarily lead to an out\\n-right ban and the many projects that have already been approved can proceed, limiting any short-\\nterm impact on the oil and gas industry. The main purpose of the pause is likely to give the new \\ngovernment time to review policies in this area. \\nIn addition to new projects and infrastructure developments, there are two other factors to be taken \\ninto account. Firstly, the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) has been increased to $51 per tonne (reversing \\na cut to $7 per tonne under the previous administration), which is used in permit and financial deci\\n-sion-making processes. Secondly, from July 2021 the Democrats will have a majority on the Federal \\nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC), giving them the ability to account for the SCC and change \\nthe focus of the Commission, which could potentially restrict pipeline project approvals. Both of \\nthese developments have the potential to limit future fossil fuel-related projects.\\n247\\nMethane emission policy is another important area of change. Methane is a gas that is more \\npotent than carbon in the atmosphere, but remains in it for a much shorter time. As the oil and \\ngas industry is one of the largest sources of methane emissions (e.g. from flaring and leaks), it is \\nnaturally a target for emissions reduction policies. The current administration wants to impose \\nrules on methane emissions from both new and existing installations. \\nTransportation policy\\nIn terms of the adoption of EVs, which already enjoy subsidies at a state and federal level, charging \\ninfrastructure is one of the major factors that helps facilitate mass adoption and it could receive \\na boost from the administration™s infrastructure plans that will reach into the trillions of dollars. \\nWhile the final size and scope is still under negotiation in Congress, the administration would see \\na share of this spending earmarked for investment in the EV industry, including support for a net\\n-work of 500,000 charging points across the US by 2030. \\nStandards for the fuel efficiency of passenger vehicles are set to be tightened, after being loos\\n-ened by the previous administration, with the creation of the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) \\nvehicles rule. Between 2021 and 2026, fuel economy is only required to increase by 1.5% p.a. The \\nnew administration instructed the EPA to revisit these standards in 2021 and they are likely to rise \\nnearer to the 5% annual increase of the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard from \\nthe Obama administration. Furthermore, the ability of California and other states to set their own \\nstandards will again be reviewed and could determine whether targets should be nationwide or \\nwhether individual states can pursue their own ambitions. \\n7.2.2 European Union\\nSince setting out the European Green Deal in 2020, a framework establishing the key aim of the \\nEU to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, the EU™s energy policies have continued to evolve at a \\nrelatively fast pace. Importantly, in April 2021 the EU agreed to enshrine the 2050 target into law, \\ntherefore, requiring all Member States to act to achieve this target. \\nEfforts were also refocused on targets within the current decade, as progress made in the years \\nto 2030 will be vital in determining whether the 2050 goals can be met. Acknowledging that the \\nspeed of progress has to be increased, in September 2020 the European Commission proposed \\nincreasing the 2030 target to reduce GHG emissions by 55%, compared to 1990 levels, from the \\noriginal 40% target.\\nWith these overall climate policy goals set, the Commission sought out proposals for strength\\n-ening legalization across the board to facilitate the new targets. On 14 July 2021 a wide-ranging \\nset of proposals, the ‚Fit for 55™ package, were released. These are explored in more detail below. \\nClimate policies\\nThe reduction of GHG emissions in the EU is covered primarily on two fronts: by the EU ETS and \\nthe Effort Sharing Regulation. The latter formalizes emission reduction targets of EU Member \\nStates for 2030 and 2050, while taking into account the per-capita GDP of each country. The ETS, \\non the other hand, applies to certain economic sectors and uses a ‚cap and trade™ style system, \\nsetting an upper limit (cap) on GHG emissions each year. The cap is gradually lowered to encour\\n-age participants of the system to reduce their emissions or pay for allowances to cover their emis\\n-sions liability. \\nThe ‚Fit for 55™ proposals, if adopted, would dramatically change the ETS, which has been \\ndesigned to target an overall reduction in emissions of 43% by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. \\nDespite the European Commission expecting this target to be surpassed, potentially achieving a \\n248\\n51% reduction, the EU is looking to the system to contribute more towards the overall 2030, target \\nof 55%. Therefore, the ‚cap™ on emissions, which was already due to drop by 2.2% each year as part \\nof the scheme™s fourth phase, will now drop by 4.2% each year from 2021Œ2030. As a result, the \\nscheme would target a 61% emissions reduction in sectors covered by the ETS by 2030.\\nThe scope of the system will change too, with the maritime sector being phased in over a four-\\nyear period up to 2026. It will join the existing sectors including power generation, energy-inten\\n-sive industry, raw materials production and aviation. The aviation sector itself will no longer have \\nseparate allowances and overall will be aligned with the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction \\nScheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) initiative. \\nA separate ETS has been proposed for the EU™s road transportation and buildings sectors. These \\nsectors are to be kept separate (at least initially) to allow the main ETS to continue to operate as it \\nhas been and in recognition of the differing potential for emissions reduction of these two sectors. \\nThese sectors are responsible for large shares of the EU™s total emissions and, while over 50% of \\nbuildings emissions are covered in some way by the existing ETS, the proposals highlight the sec\\n-tor™s potential to benefit from an ETS, reducing emission costs effectively in a market-based system. \\n In a significant development, the EU has proposed a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism \\n(CBAM) that would be phased in starting in 2026. The EU had previously highlighted the difficulty of \\nestablishing such a mechanism. The CBAM aims to help better solve the issue of ‚carbon leakage™ \\nwhereby manufacturers move operations that are emissions intensive outside of the EU to avoid \\nany additional costs due to the EU™s more stringent climate policy (and ultimately not contributing \\nto reducing global emissions). The mechanism would require the surrender of CBAM certificates \\nfor imports of selected products at the border and these would reflect a market price for carbon. \\nIt is expected this would encourage trading partners to lower their own GHG emissions. \\nAs well as reducing net emissions, targeted by the above policies, the other component of the \\n‚net zero™ emissions equation is absorbed emissions where ‚carbon sinks™ remove carbon from \\nthe environment. The EU™s 2018 Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) regulation \\nsought to ensure that the sector does not have any net emissions for the period of 2021Œ2030 and \\ndiscourages the removal of carbon sinks. Changes in how the regulation operates are proposed \\nfor the second half of the applicable period and would set targets for individual Member States \\nrather than provide an overall EU target. After 2030, the regulation would encompass the entire \\nland sector with the addition of agricultural non-CO\\n2 GHG emissions. \\nEnergy policies\\nThe ‚Fit for 55™ proposals also seek to strengthen legislation covering renewable energy and \\nenergy efficiency. The Renewable Energy Directive has set a 2030 target of 32% renewable energy \\nin terms of gross final energy consumption, but it is suggested to increase this to 40%. In another \\npotential change to the energy mix, the amendment to the directive would seek to phase out bio\\n-mass from electricity generation from 2026. \\nThe EU™s Energy Efficiency Directive was amended once before in 2018 to install a higher energy \\nefficiency target of 32.5% for 2030 (compared to projections for 2030 generated in 2007). This \\nreduction target could now rise to 39% of primary energy consumption. More focus is also being \\nplaced on the buildings sector with an expansion of the directive to also require public sector \\nbuildings to be renovated at a rate of 3% p.a. \\nTransportation policies\\nAs well as the addition of the road transportation sector to a new ETS, the EU has submitted an \\namendment that would increase the EU™s emissions performance standards for passenger cars \\n249\\nand light commercial vehicles. Emissions reduction targets for new vehicles in 2030 have been \\nincreased while, from 2035, a 100% reduction in emissions, compared to 2021 levels, has been \\nadded. Moreover, the EU announced the ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative and the FuelEU Maritime Initiative \\nin July 2021. The former would require a gradual increase in the use of sustainable aviation fuels \\nat EU airports. For the maritime sector, the primary mechanism to drive improvements in marine \\nfuel is a new limit on GHG content of energy used by ships that visit ports within the EU. \\nFurthermore, taxes applied to fossil fuels could change with a revision to the Energy Taxation \\nDirective of 2003, which among other reforms would seek to remove any incentive for fossil fuels \\nand consider tax rates based on energy content and environmental performance.\\n7.2.3 ChinaIn September 2020, China announced that it would reach a peak in its CO\\n2 emissions by 2030 and \\nachieve ‚carbon neutrality™ by 2060. More clarity on these targets was expected from the pub\\n-lication of the 14th FYP and long-term targets for 2035, published at China™s National People™s \\nCongress in March 2021. However, the 14th FYP and long-term targets to 2035 did not cover \\nspecific details on climate- and energy-related policies. These may now be published in a sep\\n-arate energy plan possibly later in 2021 or 2022. The 14th FYP does set targets for reducing \\nenergy intensity and carbon emission intensity at 13.5% and 18%, respectively, from 2021Œ2025. \\nIt also mentions the possibility of setting a CO\\n2 emission cap. Important aspects of the FYP are \\nenergy security and self-sufficiency, which was underscored in some of the high-level details \\nmade available. \\nNon-fossil fuels (renewables and nuclear) would play a more important role in the primary energy \\nmix with their share increasing to 20% in 2025 and 25% in 2030. Targets for specific fuels, such as \\nwind and PV, are not yet available. Natural gas is expected to have a more prominent role in the \\nenergy mix, due to its lower CO\\n2 emissions, which could help to reach an emissions peak in 2030. \\nThe plan also mentions coal and its clean and more efficient use through large, highly efficient \\nplants, while closing old and inefficient coal-fired facilities. This is an important aspect, as it tar\\n-gets more efficient use of primary fuel, while recognizing the importance of this fuel for China™s \\nenergy mix and energy security.\\nThe plan also focuses on the development of technology from EVs to hydrogen, as well as on the \\nproduction of gas turbines and LNG ships. Oil and gas upstream technology is also one of the top\\n-ics of the plan, including the development of deep-sea production platforms. \\nFurthermore, in mid-2021, China launched the world™s largest ETS market as one of the tools to \\nreach its 2030 and 2060 targets on emissions. It currently only covers the power and heat genera\\n-tion sector (around 40% of total CO\\n2 emissions), but could potentially include other sectors in the \\nfuture. The initial price was reportedly around $7.5 per tCO\\n2, which is still significantly lower rela\\n-tive to the EU ETS price. \\nRelated to the road transportation sector, China published its ‚Technology Roadmap 2.0 for Energy-\\nSaving and New Energy Vehicles™ in late 2020. This roadmap contains guidelines and ambitions for \\npassenger and commercial vehicles to 2035. At the time of writing, however, it is understood that \\nthis roadmap is not binding. According to the roadmap, ‚new energy vehicles™ should have a 40% \\nshare of total sales by 2030 and 50% by 2035. In 2035, all ICE vehicles (new sales) should at least \\nbe hybrid, with average fuel consumption of four litres per 100 km, down from 5.6 litres in 2025 \\nand 4.8 litres in 2030. Furthermore, the roadmap calls for China to have one million hydrogen-\\nfueled vehicles by 2035. For commercial vehicles, the average fuel consumption in 2035 should be \\nreduced by around 15%, and for busses by 20%, from 2019 levels.\\n250\\n7.2.4 IndiaEnergy policies in India are based on the seven major goals as stipulated by Prime Minister \\nNarendra Modi in October 2020. These include:\\nŁ Accelerating efforts to move towards a gas-based economy;\\nŁ Cleaner use of fossil fuels, particularly petroleum and coal;\\nŁ Greater reliance on domestic sources to drive biofuels;\\nŁ Achieving the renewables target of 450 GW by 2030;\\nŁ Increasing the contribution of electricity to decarbonize mobility;\\nŁ Moving into emerging fuels, including hydrogen; and\\nŁ Digital innovation across all the energy systems.\\nAll these are explained in greater detail in Chapter 9, Section 9.4.\\n7.2.5 JapanIn April 2021, Japan announced its revised 2030 target to reduce GHG emissions by 46%, relative to \\n2013 levels, and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the country would strive to reduce GHG emis\\n-sions by as much as 50% in the same timeframe. This was significant, since the previous target \\nwas 26%. The new reduction target is in line with a previously announced (October 2020) commit\\n-ment to become carbon neutral by 2050. \\nThe current energy strategy of Japan (from 2018) foresees an increase of the share of renewa\\n-bles in power generation to 22Œ24% (up from 17% in 2018) and nuclear to 20Œ22% (up from 6% in \\n2018) by 2030. However, given the new revised GHG emission reduction commitments, these tar\\n-gets could be revamped in the near future. One step in this direction was the announcement by \\nthe Ministry of Industry that Japan intends to increase its offshore wind power capacity to 10 GW \\nby 2030 and up to 45 GW by 2040.\\nIn the transportation sector, the fuel economy standard for passenger and light commercial vehi\\n-cles sets a target of 20.3 km/l and 17.9 km/l by 2020 and 2022, respectively. The 2020 standard \\napplies to diesel vehicles weighing less than 3.5 metric tonnes, as well as gasoline and LPG vehi\\n-cles. These targets should result in a 13.4% improvement in efficiency in 2025, compared to 2015 \\nlevels, for trucks and other heavy vehicles, and 14.3% for buses.\\nIn the longer-term, Japan initially intended to increase the sales of next-generation vehicles from \\nbelow 40% in 2018 to 50Œ70% in 2030. However, given more ambitious plans related to GHG emis\\n-sion reductions, these targets may need to be revised up. Accordingly, Japan recently announced \\nit would ban sales of new gasoline or diesel-only passenger cars by 2035, but will allow HEVs and \\nPHEVs. No further details were available at the time of writing. \\nJapan also has a regulatory framework that ensures compliance with mandatory efficiency stand\\n-ards for large-scale non-residential buildings through incentive measures that include a perfor\\n-mance improvement planning certification system and energy labelling system. The government \\nexpects to achieve net-zero emissions in new building construction projects by 2030. \\nFinally, Japan™s Fifth Strategic Energy Plan calls for using CCUS technology to meet its energy and \\nclimate goals beginning from 2020. It has already made provisions for this in its marine pollution \\nprotection law covering offshore and sub-seabed storage.\\n7.2.6 The UKIn a recent move, the UK increased its emissions reduction targets to 78% by 2035, compared \\nto 1990 levels. For the time being, this is arguably the most ambitious target of major world \\n251\\neconomies and should be enshrined into law during 2021. Among other actions, the pathway to \\nmeeting this target includes the continued deployment of renewables in the electricity sector and \\nelectrification of the transportation and residential sectors. Furthermore, support for low-carbon \\nhydrogen is envisaged. \\nThe UK ETS, effective from January 2021, replaced the EU ETS following Brexit. This scheme cov\\n-ers emission-intensive industry, power generation and flights within the UK and the European \\nEconomic Area. The UK ETS is similar to the EU ETS, and the aim is to align it to the UK 2050 net \\nzero targets by 2024. \\nIn 2018, the UK published ‚The Road to Zero™ that outlines the next steps towards cleaner road \\ntransport and its industrial strategy. This provided a long-term plan for zero emissions for most \\nlight vehicles by 2040. However, in line with the more ambitious emission reduction targets \\nalready mentioned, the UK decided to ban new sales of ICEs from 2030, although some hybrids \\nwill be allowed until 2035. The transport decarbonization plan (effective 2021) established a ‚Jet \\nZero Council™ whose target is to develop a net-zero emission aviation sector. \\nThe government published a ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution in 2020. The new strat\\n-egy aims to make the manufacturing and construction sectors ‚greener™ and replace gas boilers in \\nexisting homes with low-carbon heating systems. Starting from 2023, gas boilers will be banned in \\nnew buildings and pilot projects will allow up to 20% blending of hydrogen into the gas distribution \\ngrid. There is a temporary target for 1 GW of hydrogen production capacity by 2025 and a small-scale \\nhydrogen heating trial in the same year. The government™s plan sets a low-carbon hydrogen capacity \\ntarget of 5 GW for 2030. Some companies such as BP and Equinor have announced plans to invest in \\nlow-carbon hydrogen (green and blue) in the medium- and long-term. \\n The government™s 2020 budget set aside about £1 billion for the development of a new CCUS \\nInfrastructure Fund to establish support for various carbon capture projects, including projects \\nfor developing blue hydrogen infrastructure combined with the CCUS. \\nThe UK government also supports small modular nuclear reactors. Up to £500 million was made \\navailable for these projects. However, the support for future large-scale nuclear project develop\\n-ment is currently unclear. \\n7.2.7 CanadaCanada™s NDC calls to reduce GHG emissions by 30% by 2030, relative to 2005 levels. However, it \\nwas announced at the Leaders™ Summit on Climate, convened by the Biden administration in April \\n2021, that by 2030 Canada would reduce its GHG emissions by 40Œ45% below 2005 levels, and \\nmove forward on a path to reach ‚net-zero™ emissions by 2050. \\nThe Canadian government is at the development phase of the Clean Fuel Standard (CFS) policy \\nin order to reduce the lifecycle of carbon intensity of fuels and energy consumed. This approach \\ncould reduce about 30 million tonnes of GHG emissions annually by 2030, and also reduce the \\ncountry™s national emissions by 30% compared to 2005 levels. The CFS is expected to become \\nlegally binding by the end of 2021. To achieve this emissions reduction goal, the government plans \\nto stimulate investment and innovation in low-carbon intensity fuels and set separate require\\n-ments for liquids, gaseous and solid fuels.\\nThe CFS policy is a subset of Canada™s climate plan that will work in tandem with carbon pric\\n-ing in order to make it more effective and to create incentives for investment in innovation and \\nclean-energy technology across the economy. The CFS and the carbon pollution pricing policy are \\nintended to encourage fossil fuel suppliers, such as refineries, to install more efficient technology \\nto reduce overall emissions and earn credits that can be sold or re-used.\\n252\\nCanada also introduced a carbon tax in 2018 with the current price above $20 per tonne of CO\\n2. It is scheduled to increase to almost $140 per tonne of CO\\n2 by 2030. 7.2.8 South Korea\\nSouth Korea™s NDC calls for a 24.4% reduction in emissions by 2030, compared to 2017 lev\\n-els. However, the government is looking to increase the target to 37% by 2030 against its initial \\nbusiness-as-usual scenario levels. Moreover, on 28 October 2020, the government announced \\nits intention to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Hydrogen is specified as playing a key role in \\nachieving this target.\\nIn terms of renewables, South Korea has a supply target for renewable energies under the Third \\nRenewable Energy Basic Plan, which foresees the share of renewables at 30Œ35% by 2040. \\nHowever, its ninth basic plan for power supply and demand calls to increase the share of installed \\nrenewable capacity to 40% by 2034. Both plans aim to reduce coal and nuclear generation, while \\nincreasing the share of renewable energy generation by a factor of four. South Korea also plans to \\nimprove its renewable fuel standard by requesting that oil importers and exporters have a 3.5% \\nbiodiesel blend in transportation fuels from July 2021 through 2023, up from the 3% requirement \\nas of 2018.7.2.9 Brazil\\nThe Brazilian government recently announced its 2050 net-zero emissions target at the US-led \\nLeaders™ Summit on Climate in April 2021. Brazil also made a commitment to halt illegal defor\\n-estation in the country by 2030. Another important target is to reduce overall emissions by 43% by \\n2030, compared to 2005 levels. \\nThe government has also set a target of increasing the share of renewables in the country™s energy \\nmix to 45% by 2030. It plans to increase the share of biofuels to 18% and non-hydropower renew\\n-able energy to 28Œ33% by 2030.\\nThe PROCONVE L-6 emission standard for passenger vehicles set by the Brazilian Institute of \\nthe Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) establishes maximum emission lim\\n-its for nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and all other particulate matter. However, it did not set \\nemission limits for CO\\n2 and other greenhouse gases. The PROCONVE L-7 and L-8 were adopted \\nin 2018 with a plan that the L-7 would be in place by 2022, with the L-8 coming into force in 2025. \\nThe PROCONVE P-8 emissions standard for heavy vehicles took effect in 2018 and by 2023 all new \\nsales of vehicles that weigh over 3,856 kg will be subject to the standard. These approvals are the \\nequivalent of Euro 6 standards for emissions.\\n7.2.10 Russia\\nThe government of the Russian Federation has pledged to reduce its emissions by between 30% \\nand 35% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, although this is subject to the capacity of its forests \\nto absorb carbon emissions. The Federal Law on ‚The limitation of GHG™, which will come into \\nforce in January 2022, will define the regulatory basis for economic activities accompanied by \\nGHGs and is aimed at creating conditions for the country™s sustainable and balanced economic \\ndevelopment under the auspices of GHG reduction. Moreover, the Russian government plans to \\nadopt the country™s ‚Reduced GHG socio-economic development strategy until 2050™ by the end \\nof 2021. \\nThe government has also pledged to raise the share of renewables in final energy consumption \\nto no less than 6% by 2035, and a medium-term target of 4.5% by 2024. This target excludes the \\nlarge hydropower stations that currently produce 97.5% of the country™s clean power generation.\\n253\\nIn March 2020, the Russian government adopted a plan for the development of gas in the \\nroad transportation sector. This programme aims to increase CNG use in vehicles to 2.7 bil\\n-lion cubic metres (bcm) by 2024. To achieve this, it plans to scale up the number of CNG sta\\n-tions by 2.5-fold in order to make available CNG for the targeted increase of 40,000 natural \\ngas vehicles by 2024.\\nThe government has also encouraged the construction of CNG stations by providing 25% of the \\ncost of construction to prospective partners. It also subsidizes up to 60% of the cost for civil\\n-ian use of CNG vehicles. There is a similar plan to increase the use of LNG in the road trans\\n-portation by developing a network of 200 LNG fuel stations for long-haul heavy trucks by 2030. \\nAccording to Russia™s ‚Long-term LNG production development programme™ the country™s over\\n-all transport sector LNG demand is expected to increase to 0.8 mt by 2024 and reach 5.5 mt by \\n2035.It is also worth noting that the Russian government, through its Russia™s Fund for Prospective \\nResearch, is supporting the development of hybrid electric aircraft.\\n7.2.11 Africa\\nThe African energy sector has made progress on energy policies in recent years. Many African \\ncountries have national energy strategies, albeit with differing time horizons. In some cases, \\nthese energy strategies are part of a broader effort to boost the country™s economy and/or to \\nreduce energy poverty.\\nMajor regulatory frameworks have been put in place to achieve economic growth and sustainable \\ndevelopment in the African energy sector and to ensure access to affordable, reliable and sustain\\n-able energy for all, with a focus on UN SDG 7. The African Union Agenda 2063, the NEPAD, in col\\n-laboration with the AfDB and the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (), under\\n-take policy development and coordination at the continental and regional levels.\\nNigeria LNG Limited recently launched Train 7, which is projected to expand gas production by 35% \\nand further reduce gas flaring and GHG emissions. At the end of March 2021, the Nigerian gov\\n-ernment led by President Muhammadu Buhari formally declared 1 January 2021 to 31 December \\n2030 as ‚the Decade of Gas Development for Nigeria.™ The Mozambique natural gas master plan is \\nanother example of a policy focused on issues related to further developing home-grown energy \\nsectors, reducing emissions and helping to manage energy transitions. \\nThe government of South Africa has approved a Low Emission Development Strategy (SALEDS) \\nwith a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. It plans to achieve this goal with NDC target \\nemissions of 398Œ510 million metric tons of CO\\n2 equivalent (MMtCO\\n2e) for 2021Œ2025 and 398Œ440 \\nMMtCO2e for the 2026Œ2030 period. It also seeks to reduce emissions from the rail sector to meet \\nits 2050 target. Moreover, South Africa plans to retire up to 11 GW of its coal power plants and \\ninstall 14.8 GW of renewable energy capacity for new buildings by 2030. \\nIn June 2019, the government introduced a sectoral carbon tax on emitters above a 100,000 litres \\np.a. threshold for GHG emissions. This tax currently applies to domestic aviation, rail and water\\n-borne navigation. Moreover, passenger vehicles that emit over 120 gCO\\n2 per km are subject to the \\nemissions tax.\\nThe Kenyan government™s energy efficiency strategy calls to eliminate kerosene as a household \\nfuel by 2022 and replace it with renewable sources, for instance, by installing solar water heaters \\nin buildings served by the grid. Similarly, Mozambique aims to install 100,000 solar water heaters, \\n50,000 lighting systems, 5,000 refrigeration systems and 2,000 televisions powered by solar PV or \\nwind turbine systems in off-grid areas by 2025.\\n254\\n7.2.12 Hydrogen \\nIt is clear that hydrogen could play an important role in efforts to reduce future emissions. As a \\nresult, many countries are focusing increasingly on hydrogen as an integral part of their energy \\npolicies.The EU is moving towards making hydrogen production in the region a priority. The European \\nCommission™s ‚Hydrogen Strategy for Climate-Neutral Europe™ sets a minimum target of 40 GW \\nof hydrogen electrolyzers to be installed by 2030. The strategy focuses on the use of hydrogen in \\ntransportation, for heating in the residential and industrial sectors, as well as using hydrogen as \\na form of energy storage.\\nThe EU™s ‚Fit for 55™, published in July 2021, goes even further by proposing specific requirements \\nfor hydrogen infrastructure in the road transportation sector. If adopted, EU Member States would \\nbe required to expand the network of hydrogen fuelling stations to every 150 km. It should be noted \\nthat the European Commission supports hydrogen production based on renewable electricity. \\nHydrogen policies in the US do not directly support the production of either green or blue hydro\\n-gen. US hydrogen policies were established in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and is further sup\\n-ported by tax credits for carbon sequestration, often referred to as the 45Q tax credit, which was \\napproved in 2008. The hydrogen part of the energy law is intended to promote the development of \\nhydrogen and fuel-cell technologies in tandem with targets for the transportation sector. \\nAs a monetary incentive, the 45Q tax credit was intended to help reduce CO\\n2 emissions, but also to \\nincentivize carbon capture and sequestration in energy-intensive applications such as blue hydro\\n-gen production. The California Low Carbon Fuels Standard (LCFS) is another example of a market \\nincentive that has been implemented to encourage the uptake of low-carbon fuels. \\nIn Canada, the promotion of hydrogen is part of an energy diversification effort outlined in the \\n‚Hydrogen Strategy for Canada™, published in December 2020. Canada has a low-carbon intensity \\nelectricity grid, abundant fossil fuel reserves and geology well suited to CO\\n2 storage. In this strat\\n-egy, the Ministry of Natural Resources set a target for hydrogen delivering up to 30% of Canada™s \\nend-use energy by 2050. \\nJapan released its ‚Basic Hydrogen Strategy™ in 2017 and announced its 2050 net-zero emission \\ntarget in October 2020. Japan is a major CO\\n2 emitter and still relies on coal for a large portion of its \\nelectricity generation. The Japanese government considers hydrogen as part of a foundation for \\na modern economy, a way to lower its dependency on imported fossil fuels, as well as reduce CO\\n2 emissions to help meet its commitments to the Paris Agreement. Japan has the highest number \\nof hydrogen fuelling stations in the world (currently almost 100) and plans to expand this network \\nto 1,000 stations by 2030. \\nSouth Korea has a similar plan to extend its hydrogen network and intends to have 1,200 fuelling \\nstations by 2040. This target was set in its ‚Hydrogen Economy Roadmap™, which also envisages \\nproducing 6.2 million FCEVs by 2040.\\nChina is one of the few large countries that has so far not announced a separate hydrogen strat\\n-egy. Hydrogen is mentioned in the recently released 14th FYP, though without providing specific \\ntargets. It is very likely that these will be released in the near future, possibly later in 2021 or 2022, \\nwith expectations for more detail on specific regions and industries. Bearing in mind China™s tar\\n-get for achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, it is very likely that hydrogen will play an important \\nrole in the country™s future energy system and become the subject of additional policy measures.\\n In order to supplement Russia™s 2035 Energy Strategy, in August 2021 the government \\napproved the ‚Concept of developing hydrogen energy in the Russian Federation™. This \\n255\\ndocument identifies the goals, initiatives and measures needed to develop the Russian \\n hydrogen industry in the planning horizon to 2050. \\nThe Middle East region and Africa are also moving towards putting in place hydrogen enabling \\npolicies. Saudi Arabia™s announced green initiatives for the Kingdom and the Middle East cover a \\nlarge spectrum of measures, from increasing renewables to planting billions of trees. Hydrogen \\ndevelopment projects have already begun in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In September 2020, \\nSaudi Arabia sent the world™s first blue ammonia cargo to Japan to be used for the production of \\n emissions-free electricity.\\nAll six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states have expressed interest in developing hydrogen \\nproduction capacity. With their combination of low-cost gas resources and low-cost renewable \\nenergy, as well as other advantages, the Gulf states are strong candidates to emerge as major \\nexporters of blue and green hydrogen. Saudi Aramco and ADNOC are making a push to do just \\nthat Œ positioning themselves to build upon their well-established and extensive energy ties with \\nthe Asia-Pacific region.\\nThe African Hydrogen Partnership (AHP) was established recently and many African countries are \\nexpressing interest in developing hydrogen through national initiatives. South Africa, with a tech\\n-nological edge in GTL technologies, has the potential to supply zero-carbon fuels through green \\nhydrogen. \\nFinally, hydrogen related policies in India are outlined in Chapter 9, section 9.4.5.\\n256\\nDemand and supply uncertainties\\n257\\nKey takeaways\\nŁ To account for uncertainties related to economic growth, two alternatives to the Reference \\nCase were developed Œ a Higher GDP Case and a Lower GDP Case. \\nŁ Global GDP is projected to reach $280 trillion (2017 PPP) in the long-term in the Higher \\nGDP Case and around $253 trillion (2017 PPP) in the Lower GDP Case. These compare \\nwith almost $270 trillion (2017 PPP) in the Reference Case.\\nŁ In the Higher GDP Case, Africa plays an important role in supporting higher long-term \\neconomic growth. African oil demand in the Higher GDP Case is expected to grow to \\n 5.2 mb/d in 2026, marginally higher than in the Reference Case. However, this upside will \\nexpand to 0.7 mb/d in 2035 and 3.3 mb/d in 2045.\\nŁ With respect to economic uncertainties, the risk for oil demand over the medium-term \\nis skewed to the downside and primarily related to a potentially extended pandemic. In \\nthe long-term, the risk is rather symmetric with each case deviating from the Reference \\nCase by more than 6 mb/d at the end of the forecast period. \\nŁ The potential implications of the faster penetration of more efficient technology and \\nmore stringent policy measures are assessed in the Accelerated Policy and Technology \\n(APT) Case.Ł Oil demand in the road transportation sector in the APT Case could decline by some \\n 3 mb/d in 2045 compared to the Reference Case. \\nŁ The gap between the Reference Case and APT Case could be as high as 8 mb/d in 2045 \\nwhen oil demand in the APT Case falls below 100 mb/d.\\nŁ There are uncertainties on the oil supply side too. Lower and Higher Supply Cases indi\\n-cate a range of some 7.5 mb/d in the medium-term and as much as 10 mb/d in the\\n long-term, heavily skewed to the downside. \\nŁ In the Lower Supply Case, the impact on US tight oil becomes rapidly visible. Rather than \\nrecovering from its slump as projected in the Reference Case, US tight oil declines grad\\n-ually until it stages a modest rebound in the latter part of the 2020s, albeit not to pre-\\npandemic levels. The impact of a slowdown in output in other non-OPEC countries takes \\nlonger to materialize, but eventually project cancellations, lower investment and to some \\nextent, policy measures, contribute to the downside. \\nŁ The Higher Supply Case projects relatively modest upside for US tight oil (above \\nthe cumulative 1.7 mb/d growth assumed in the Reference Case for 2022 and 2023) \\nuntil the latter part of the medium-term time horizon; by 2026, production is around \\n 1 mb/d higher, and output plateaus at around 16 mb/d before declining again from \\nthe mid-2030s. Other non-OPEC supply responds more quickly, adding 1.2 mb/d \\nto the upside by 2026 and 2.5 mb/d in the long-term, as growth centres including \\nGuyana, Brazil and others add projects, and unconventional and frontier resources \\nelsewhere are tapped. \\n258\\nDevelopments over the past year have made it clear that there are a variety of uncertainties related \\nto both future oil demand and supply, including prospects for economic growth. This Outlook \\nassumes a strong economic recovery in 2021 and 2022, solid GDP growth over the medium-term \\nand decelerating growth during the rest of the forecast period. However, this view is subject to \\nconsiderable uncertainty on both sides. \\nUncertainty during the medium-term period is skewed to the downside on the back of a possibly \\nextended pandemic, continued regional lockdowns, inflationary pressure, the ineffective use of \\nstimulus packages and rising financial stress leading to a higher number of bankruptcies. \\nOn the other hand, accelerated vaccination rates, the rapid suppression of COVID-19 and the \\neffective use of huge stimulus packages in advanced economies could not only trigger stronger \\ngrowth in these countries, but also have long-term spill-over effects in many developing coun\\n-tries, especially in Africa. \\nTherefore, to account for this uncertainty, two alternative cases were developed, each comple\\n-menting the Reference Case and depicting different, but possible economic developments.\\nSecondly, there is a growing awareness among policymakers of the need to accelerate actions \\naddressing climate change, and an increasing public acceptance of products and services with \\na lower environmental footprint is rising. Indeed, several major countries, including EU Member \\nStates, the US, Japan, the UK, Canada and Brazil have recently announced their intention to reach \\nnet-zero emissions by 2050, with China aiming to reach a peak in its emissions before 2030 and \\nbe carbon-neutral by 2060. At the same time, negotiations at the international level to achieve the \\nParis Agreement goals are intensifying. \\nWhile these are all welcome initiatives, they inevitably bear an element of uncertainty. This is not \\nonly in respect to their viability, but also due to the lack of clarity on how these targets will be \\nachieved. Despite the fact that these targets are extremely ambitious and challenging, any sub\\n-stantive move in this direction would likely have significant implications for future oil demand and \\nsupply.\\nThirdly, 2021 has been marked by a number of announcements that potentially could have far \\nreaching implications for oil demand in the road transport sector. The European Commission, in \\nits ‚Fit for 55™ package of measures, proposed that all new cars in the EU registered as of 2035 \\nshould have zero emissions. Similar initiatives also exist in the UK, Iceland, California (with vary\\n-ing timetables and engine specifics), while Norway intends to achieve this already by 2025. \\nThere also is a move in this direction by major car makers, especially in Europe. Several leading \\nmanufacturers, such as Volkswagen, Ford, Stellantis and Audi, recently announced plans to stop \\ndeveloping and selling cars with ICEs, at least in some markets (typically Europe), within the time\\n-frame of this Outlook. This could accelerate the electrification of the road transport sector beyond \\nwhat is assumed in the Reference Case. \\nTo assess the likely impact of both tightened energy policies and a faster penetration of EVs, \\ntogether with other options to improve energy efficiency, the Accelerated Policy and Technology \\nCase (APT Case) was developed and is presented in this chapter.\\nFinally, 2020 and 2021 were years that saw significant underinvestment in the oil upstream sec\\n-tor. Despite higher oil prices, many companies preferred to pay higher dividends or improve their \\nbalance sheets instead of making large investments in new oilfields. Moreover, several large oil \\ncompanies, again especially in Europe, redirected part of their investments into renewable energy \\nand infrastructure projects, hence reducing the resources available for the upstream sector. This \\n chapter attempts to shed light on how these developments could affect future non-OPEC oil supply.\\n259\\nClearly, these alternative cases do not address all potential oil industry uncertainties, but they \\nserve to indicate the range of uncertainty in the years to come.\\n8.1 Economic uncertainties\\nThe long-term link between oil demand and the level of economic activity is complex. Common \\nsense suggests that GDP growth should result in higher oil demand in a country/region, with the \\nstrength of the link depending on how oil intensive the economy is or, in turn, how large is the \\nshare of oil intensive industry and transport services in the GDP composition. \\nHowever, with changing GDP structures and increasing options for oil substitution, this link can \\nchange significantly over time, especially if a longer horizon is considered. Despite the expecta\\n-tion of a weakening GDP impact on future oil demand, the level of economic activity will remain an \\nimportant driver, especially in developing countries. Therefore, it is important to assess the likely \\nimplications of alternative paths of economic development on future oil demand.\\nTo account for the uncertainty stemming from differing economic assumptions, similar to last \\nyear™s WOO, two alternatives to the Reference Case were developed. Bearing in mind current cir\\n-cumstances, it is unavoidable to start with broad assumptions about the direction of the economic \\nrecovery from the COVID-19-induced crisis in 2020. As stated in Chapter 1, global GDP is expected \\nto grow by 5.5% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2022. \\nThese growth assumptions are based on the expectation that COVID-19 is broadly contained and \\nwill not continue to materially impact global economic growth patterns over the medium-term. It \\nis also important to note that this growth is unevenly distributed among major regions. The bulk \\nof it comes from developing countries, which are set to expand by more than 6% in 2021 and 5% in \\n2022. Considering that the decline for this group of countries was 2.2% in 2020, they show strong \\ngrowth potential.\\nMoreover, Chapter 1 also emphasized the potential for downward global GDP revisions in the case \\nof a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. This issue stands as a starting point for developing the Lower \\nGDP Case, which assumes that the world will still be plagued by COVID-19 throughout most of \\nthe medium-term. In this case, new COVID-19 variants emerge in various parts of the world and \\nlead to renewed regional or local lockdowns. While COVID-19 testing is widespread and the treat\\n-ment of patients improves, vaccination progress remains slow, especially in developing countries. \\nMoreover, some virus variants prove to be resistant to vaccines, which supports scepticism in \\nsome parts of the population, creating another barrier to successfully containing the pandemic. \\nUnder these conditions, industries dependent on the global trade of goods and various compo\\n-nents will suffer the most. As a result, the number of bankruptcies will grow, starting with smaller \\ncompanies, but gradually affecting major international corporations too. \\nAn extended period of occasional lockdowns will increasingly affect public finances. A large part of \\nstimulus packages will be used to compensate for shortfalls to prevent further bankruptcies and \\ngrowing unemployment, while a smaller part will be available to revive economic growth. Hence \\nincreasing inflationary pressure. Moreover, some countries that were already heavily indebted \\nbefore the crisis could face defaults on sovereign debt. \\nIn this case, even after the pandemic is controlled in later years, the effects are felt for longer \\nas it will take some time to return to growth levels assumed in the Reference Case. An extended \\nperiod of lockdowns will likely change trade relations and increase protectionism which, in turn, \\nwill reduce global trade. In addition, internal unrest in economies hurt by the pandemic could \\nincrease. In this case, lingering social issues that were suppressed during lockdowns could \\n re-emerge and further extend the period of lower economic growth.\\n260\\nOn the positive side, the Higher GDP Case represents a world where the pandemic is soon \\ncontained. Vaccination programmes progress faster in both developed and developing coun\\n-tries. Advanced economies are ready to provide vaccines to a broad range of countries and the \\nentire vaccination process is well organized. Moreover, modified vaccines prove to be effec\\n-tive against new variants, so that the number of global infections declines faster than in the \\nReference Case. \\nConsumer confidence returns relatively quickly and spending grows, leading to higher demand for \\ngoods and services which, in turn, supports new business opportunities. Moreover, the stimulus \\nmeasures of major economies are primarily used for investments in industries with high growth \\npotential. Furthermore, they drive technological innovation that generates economic growth, \\nincreases productivity and creates new jobs. Importantly, this ignites growth that is sustainable \\nand continues during the long-term period with significant spillover effects for developing coun\\n-tries, in particular, Africa. \\nUnder the Higher GDP Case, investors increasingly find opportunities to develop new projects \\nin Africa. Given its young, dynamic and growing labour force; rapid urbanization; required infra\\n-structure expansion; and rich resource endowments, this continent provides a unique opportunity \\nfor economic development. This attracts investors™ attention and starts a spiral of positive growth \\nwhich, in turn, attracts higher capital inflows. \\nFigures 8.1 and 8.2 present the quantification of the narrative of these two cases. Figure 8.1 shows \\nglobal GDP growth rates during the medium-term period, while Figure 8.2 translates these growth \\nrates into absolute GDP levels (in billions of US dollars 2017 PPP), including the extension to the \\nlong-term period.\\nThe difference between the Reference Case and the two alternative cases is already visible in \\n2022. The extended pandemic situation in the Lower GDP Case limits global GDP growth to 3.3% \\nin 2022 (compared to 4.1 % in the Reference Case) and 3% in 2023, also significantly lower than \\nFigure 8.1\\nGlobal GDP growth rates in the medium-term, 2019Œ2026\\nFigure 8.1\\nmboe/dŒ4Œ3Œ2Œ10123456720192020202120222023202420252026Higher GDP CaseReference CaseLower GDP Case%Source: OPEC.\\n261\\nFigure 8.2\\nGlobal GDP in the long-term, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.2\\nmboe/d10012014016018020022024026028030020192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045Higher GDP CaseReference CaseLower GDP Casetrillion $(2017 PPP)the Reference Case. Moreover, these lower rates of around 3% p.a. are expected to persist for the \\nrest of the medium-term. The gap in annual GDP growth rates to the Reference Case gradually \\nnarrows, but rates in the Lower GDP Case remain below those in the Reference Case for most of \\nthe forecast period.\\nA different pattern evolves in the Higher GDP Case. Generally, the difference in annual GDP growth \\nrates between this case and the Reference Case is smaller, in the range of 0.1 to 0.4 pp during \\nthe forecast period. Moreover, this difference is relatively small in the initial years of the forecast \\nperiod, while the gap widens gradually to around 0.4 pp in 2026. It then remains at this level for \\nseveral years before returning to around 0.1 pp towards the end of the forecast period.\\nThese differences appear to be marginal, but the cumulative effect at the global level during the \\nentire medium-term period is significant (Figure 8.2). Indeed, the difference between the two \\nalternative cases rises to around $5.6 trillion (2017 PPP) at the end of the medium-term period, \\nwhich represents almost 4% of global economic activity by then. The difference compared to the \\nReference Case is higher for the Lower GDP Case, at more than $3.2 trillion (2017 PPP), while the \\ncomparable number for the Higher GDP Case is more than $2.3 trillion (2017 PPP).\\nAs already indicated by corresponding growth rates, this gap widens significantly over the long-\\nterm. The global GDP is projected to be above $280 trillion (2017 PPP) in the Higher GDP Case \\nand around $253 trillion (2017 PPP) in the Lower GDP Case. This compares to almost $270 trillion \\n(2017 PPP) in the Reference Case.\\nIn the Higher GDP Case, Africa plays an important role in supporting stronger GDP growth in the \\nlong-term. Higher annual GDP growth rates in Africa will start emerging during the medium-\\nterm, but it will take time until these make a material difference in GDP levels. This, together \\nwith GDP levels in the other two considered cases, is presented in Figure 8.3. Therefore, the \\ndifference between these cases is relatively small during the current decade. However, this \\n262\\nchanges after 2030, especially for the Higher GDP Case as annual growth rates in the region \\nsurpass 4% p.a. and continue expanding towards the level of 7% p.a. at the end of the forecast \\nperiod.In the Reference Case, Africa™s GDP grows from less than $7 trillion (2017 PPP) in 2020 to around \\n$9 trillion (2017 PPP) in 2030 and further to almost $16 trillion (2017 PPP) in 2045. This figure is \\nprojected to be more than $6 trillion (2017 PPP) higher in the Higher GDP Case reaching almost \\n$22 trillion (2017 PPP).Figure 8.3\\nAfrica™s GDP in the long-term, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.3\\nmboe/d051015202520192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045trillion $(2017 PPP)Reference CaseHigher GDP CaseLower GDP CaseHowever, long-term impacts on Africa™s GDP are estimated to be less pronounced under the \\nLower GDP Case. Because of its high growth potential, Africa is expected to remain resistant to \\ndownward pressure in this case with the region™s GDP projected to decline by around $2 trillion \\n(2017 PPP) compared to the Reference Case in 2045. \\nImplications for oil demand\\nFigures 8.4 and 8.5 present the summary of expected implications on future oil demand under the \\nHigher and Lower GDP Cases. It is worth noting that these implications are assessed under an \\nassumption that major policy measures in the alternative cases remain broadly similar to those \\noutlined in the Reference Case. At the same time, however, issues like faster efficiency improve\\n-ments under the Higher GDP Case and some demand rebound due to expected lower prices under \\nthe Lower GDP Case are reflected in projections. \\nOn this basis, the gap between oil demand in the Reference Case and alternative cases evolves \\nduring the medium-term period and is skewed towards the Lower GDP Case. The difference \\nbetween this case and the Reference Case is forecast to be in the range of 2 mb/d by 2026, while \\nthe corresponding number for the Higher GDP Case is 1.3 mb/d. \\nIn the Higher GDP Case, long-term oil demand implications are much more pronounced as \\ndemand rises to almost 115 mb/d by 2045, which is more than 6 mb/d higher than the Reference \\n263\\nFigure 8.4\\nIncremental oil demand over the medium-term, 2020Œ2026\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.4\\nmboe/d0246810121416Higher GDP CaseReference CaseLower GDP Casemb/dFigure 8.5\\nGlobal oil demand in alternative cases, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nCase. Naturally, this mirrors the narrative of the case and the corresponding pattern for global \\nGDP. Therefore, oil demand increases only slightly faster during the current decade and extends \\nthe difference by almost 2 mb/d in 2030. By then, around one-third of this difference is expected to \\nbe linked to the OECD, where oil demand will be on a declining trajectory, though at a slower pace \\nthan in the Reference Case (Table 8.1). \\nHowever, this temporary positive oil demand effect in the OECD due to faster GDP growth will \\nbe broadly offset in the long-term by the second-order effects in the higher GDP environment. \\nFigure 8.5\\nmboe/d2045Lower GDP Case8085909510010511011512020192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045mb/dHigher GDP CaseReference CaseLower GDP Case264\\nAn example is that disposable incomes available to households would be greater in the Higher \\nGDP Case, potentially stimulating a gradual shift towards a more efficient use of oil including, for \\ninstance, more energy-efficient household appliances; more cars with better fuel economy (includ\\n-ing hybrids and EVs); better building insulation; and improved cooling systems. Furthermore, gov\\n-ernments would likely be in a position to raise subsidies for clean-energy initiatives, while the pri\\n-vate sector could invest more in advanced technologies and processes. The net effect would be a \\nslowly diminishing gap between OECD oil demand in the Higher GDP and Reference Cases.\\nIn contrast to the OECD, oil demand in the non-OECD regions is set to remain on a growth trajec\\n-tory in the Higher GDP Case during the entire forecast period. The second-order effect of higher \\nGDP will play a marginal role in non-OECD countries as it will apply to more advanced countries \\nwith higher GDP per capita only. \\nFor many countries, including most countries in Africa, higher GDP will boost oil demand even higher \\nthan the corresponding change, \\nceteris paribus\\n. In this case, oil products would be affordable to a larger \\npart of the population and replace traditional fuels; car ownership would increase with the majority \\nbeing ICE-based vehicles; and new industries and trade relationships would arise, thus providing sup\\n-port to oil demand. Projections indicate that under this scenario, oil demand in the non-OECD could be \\nas high as 80 mb/d by 2045, more than 6 mb/d higher than in the Reference Case. \\nTable 8.1\\nOECD and non-OECD oil demand in alternative cases, 2019Œ2045\\n2019202020252030203520402045OECDHigher GDP Case47.742.146.744.641.337.634.3Reference Case\\n47.742.146.344.040.837.334.2Lower GDP Case\\n47.742.145.542.939.535.932.7Non-OECDHigher GDP Case52.348.657.964.069.574.980.3Reference Case\\n52.348.657.362.667.170.874.1Lower GDP Case\\n52.348.656.360.563.966.769.2Source: OPEC.\\nmb/d\\nAround half of this demand increase in non-OECD countries is associated with Africa. Oil demand \\nin this region declined slightly in 2020, to around 4 mb/d, on the back of the COVID-19 pandemic \\nand the related global GDP decline. However, demand returned to growth territory in 2021 and, in \\nthe Reference Case, is projected to reach 5.1 mb/d by 2026 and 8.4 mb/d in 2045. \\nAs presented in Figure 8.6, Africa™s oil demand in the Higher GDP Case will grow to 5.2 mb/d \\nin 2026, marginally higher than in the Reference Case. However, this difference will expand to \\n 0.7 mb/d in 2035 and 3.3 mb/d in 2045. The bulk of this overall difference will take place during the \\nlast ten years of the forecast period when annual GDP growth in Africa will be in the range of 5.5% \\nto 6.8% and demand will double compared to 2020. The combined effect of these two parameters \\nwill result in rapid oil demand growth, which is projected to reach 11.7 mb/d in 2045.\\nIn contrast to the Higher GDP Case, Africa™s oil demand will likely be much less affected in the \\nLower GDP Case. Oil demand in this case will be around 1.1 mb/d lower than in the Reference \\nCase in 2045. This is because the GDP decline will be more widely spread across regions and \\n265\\nthe counterbalancing effect of lower prices plays a much lesser role. Moreover, the GDP decline \\nis more concentrated in other regions, such as OECD Americas, OECD Europe, India, China and \\nOther Asia. Therefore, oil demand in these regions will also drop accordingly.\\nFigure 8.6\\nOil demand in Africa in alternative cases, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.6\\nmboe/d0246810121420192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045Reference CaseHigher GDP CaseLower GDP Casemb/dAs presented in Table 8.1, the distinct pattern between the OECD and non-OECD is less pronounced. \\nDifferences to the Reference Case projections for these regions evolve almost in parity over the \\nmedium-term period, with both diverging by around 1 mb/d from the Reference Case. In the later \\nyears of the forecast period, these differences widen further for both regions, but the decline in \\nnon-OECD is significantly larger. Non-OECD demand is projected to reach 69.2 mb/d in 2045, which \\nwould be almost 5 mb/d lower than in the Reference Case. Corresponding figures for the OECD are \\nexpected at 32.7 mb/d in 2045, which is 1.5 mb/d lower compared to the Reference Case.\\nIt needs to be emphasized that the implementation of any necessary production adjustments in \\nresponse to reduced oil demand assumed in the Lower GDP Case would have a bearing, as these \\nwould affect the so-called ‚marginal barrel™. The projections shown in Figure 8.5 and Table 8.1 \\npresume only minimal impact on the structure of the marginal barrel, which in turn indicates only \\nmodestly lower oil prices and the related rebound effect on oil demand. \\nTo conclude, there are two observations worth noting. With respect to economic uncertainties, the \\nrisk for oil demand over the medium-term is skewed towards downward revisions and primarily \\nrelated to a potentially extended pandemic. Turning to the long-term prospects, the risk is rather \\nsymmetric, with each side deviating from the Reference Case by more than 6 mb/d at the end of \\nthe forecast period. The combined effect of these two alternative cases indicates that future oil \\ndemand could be in a broad range of almost 13 mb/d, anywhere between 102 mb/d and 115 mb/d. \\nThis is a clear sign of increased uncertainty for future oil demand.\\n8.2 Policy and technology uncertainties\\nEnergy efficiency improvements have been long recognized as a key policy element aimed at \\nreducing emissions. Typically, these policy measures include financial and fiscal instruments, \\nsuch as energy audits, subsidies, loans, tax credits; direct regulations in the form of minimum \\n266\\nenergy efficiency standards; building codes; various labels and certificates; and other measures \\nsuch as voluntary agreements. \\nAt the same time, energy efficiency is not just a matter of policies and regulations. It is also closely \\nlinked to technological developments. In fact, it is technology that provides the ways and means \\nfor the more efficient use of energy, whereas policies can support both technological progress and \\nits accelerated implementation.\\nConsidering oil demand specifically, an APT Case has been developed to assess the potential \\nfuture oil demand implications if additional policy measures across all major consumption sectors \\nwere adopted, thus allowing (and supporting) the faster penetration of more efficient technology. \\nIt is important to note that this case does not assume any major technology breakthrough. It sim\\n-ply explores the potential for the faster penetration of existing technology that could be achieved \\nat reasonable costs if adequate incentives are in place. \\nRoad transportation is a central focus of policymakers due to the sector™s large share in global oil \\ndemand, as well as the opportunity for potential fuel substitution and efficiency improvements. Fuel \\neconomy standards are in place in all major countries and serve as a key policy tool to drive efficiency \\nimprovements in this sector, while most countries follow either the Euro standards or the CAFE stand\\n-ards in the US. While the next Euro 7 standard is being prepared in the EU, the discussion has shifted \\nto the intended deadline to discontinue selling ICE-based passenger cars in the region. Of course, this \\ndiscussion is not limited to the EU. Similar measures with varying dates and specifics regarding types \\nof vehicles are under consideration in many other countries. \\nThese discussions coincide with the maturing of technologies for AFVs, which has led to a rising \\nnumber of EV sales in advanced economies, as well as in China. This is reflected in the Outlook™s \\nReference Case projections, which assume a faster penetration of EVs compared to past Outlooks. \\nThe number of EVs is expected to surpass 100 million sometime around 2030 and reach almost \\n500 million in 2045. By then, they are expected to constitute almost 20% of the global vehicle fleet. \\nThis number rises to almost 25% if all AFVs are considered.\\nHowever, the majority of these AFVs will be concentrated in the three major demand regions Œ \\nOECD Europe, OECD Americas and China. In the case of OECD Europe, the share of AFVs is set \\nto be around 20% in 2030, 30% in 2035 and more than 50% in 2045. With this level of penetration \\nassumed in the Reference Case, even if full electrification of the passenger car segment in OECD \\nEurope is achieved by 2045, it would only result in the substitution of an additional 100 million \\nof vehicles in the region. The APT Case goes beyond this level assuming that the number of EVs \\nwould approach 700 million at the end of the forecast period. \\nSimilar to the Reference Case, the largest number of these additional AFVs in the APT Case is \\nassumed to penetrate OECD markets, China, and to a lesser extent India and Other Asia. Moreover, \\nICE efficiency improvements will also contribute to reducing future oil demand. Although the \\nReference Case assumes rather ambitious fuel economy improvements, further potential exists \\nin several areas. Therefore, the combined effect of fuel substitution and some tightening fuel effi\\n-ciencies will be that oil demand in the road transportation sector could be further reduced by \\nsome 3 mb/d in 2045 compared to the Reference Case. \\nIn addition to road transportation, as presented in Figure 8.7, significant potential for future \\ndemand reduction exists in other sectors. This is especially the case for the residential, commer\\n-cial, agriculture and ‚other industry™ sectors mainly due to options for further oil substitution by \\nelectricity and natural gas. This transformation of the industry sector has been ongoing for some \\ntime, although its effect at the global level is broadly offset by growing industrialization in develop\\n-ing countries. Nevertheless, the expansion of emission trading systems and higher carbon prices \\ncould expedite the shift to gas and electricity.\\n267\\nFigure 8.7\\nPotential efficiency improvements and fuel subsitution in the APT Case by 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.7\\nmboe/d2045Œ3.5Œ3.0Œ2.5Œ2.0Œ1.5Œ1.0Œ0.50mb/dRoadOtherindustryPetro-chemicalsAviationMarinebunkersElectricitygenerationRail/waterwaysResid./Comm./Agr.In the residential and commercial sectors, electricity could play a key role in displacing oil from \\nheating and cooking and supplementing it with natural gas wherever the gas network can be \\nexpanded. One example in this direction can be found in India with its City Gas Distribution (CGD) \\nprogramme, which aims to improve access to natural gas, especially in larger cities. To a large \\nextent, this programme is incorporated into the Reference Case. However, the faster implemen\\n-tation of the CGD and a widening of the areal coverage in India could further reduce oil demand, \\nprimarily LPG and kerosene.\\n Apart from fuel substitution, some demand reduction in these sectors could be achieved through \\nmore efficient technologies, such as low-temperature condensing boilers and heat recuperation, \\nand better insulation. The combined effect of such measures and fuel substitution is estimated to \\nreduce oil demand by 1 mb/d to 1.5 mb/d in each of these sectors.\\nIn the petrochemical industry, the largest potential for reducing oil demand is through the \\nenhanced recycling of plastics and chemicals. Some estimates indicate that less than 10% of \\nproduced plastics are recycled on a global scale despite the fact that virtually every country \\nhas a plan to improve recycling rates. Moreover, recycling (not only of plastics) is also one \\nof the cornerstones of plans for the circular economy. Although the Reference Case assumes \\nimprovements in this respect, clearly there is room for further increasing the recycling rates of \\n petrochemical products. \\nOn the efficiency side, options for further improvements are quite limited since only a small por\\n-tion of oil demand in this sector is used for energy. Nevertheless, more efficient catalysts, waste \\nheat recovery and optimized heat exchangers and process control could lead to some demand \\nreduction. Modelling exercises indicate that such reductions could be somewhere in the range of \\n0.7 mb/d in 2045, again compared to the Reference Case. \\nA similar oil demand reduction could also be achieved in the aviation sector. On the one hand, \\nthis is a sector with high growth potential, especially in terms of passenger and cargo traffic. \\nMirroring this expectation, aviation oil demand is set to grow by almost 6 mb/d in the Reference \\nCase between 2020 and 2045. \\n268\\nOn the other hand, it is also a sector with ambitious plans to improve energy efficiency and reduce \\nemissions. The IATA has set two major targets to achieve carbon neutral growth and to reduce \\nnet aviation CO2 emissions by 50% by 2050, relative to 2005 levels. Clearly, fuel economy is an \\nimportant part of this plan with direct implications for future oil demand. Another component of \\nthe plan is the substitution of jet kerosene with sustainable aviation fuels, which potentially could \\nhave far-reaching implications for oil-based products in this industry depending on how these are \\nproduced. \\nAs presented in Figure 8.7, there is much lower potential for additional demand reduction in the \\nremaining sectors Œ namely the marine sector, rail and domestic waterways, and power genera\\n-tion Œ and this is especially true with respect to potential efficiency improvements. Oil in these sec\\n-tors is mainly used in medium or large reciprocating engines with a potential for future improve\\n-ments mainly limited to the waste heat recovery, which would require significant investment. \\nTherefore, the larger potential relates to oil substitution. In the marine sector, the highest uncer\\n-tainty relates to the rate of progress in the penetration of LNG-based vessels. Ship owners appear \\nto be increasingly interested in the use of ammonia and hydrogen. However, it is unlikely that \\nthese fuels would replace a significant part of oil demand within the forecast period. \\nIn rail and domestic waterways, the main risk stems from electrification and the use of LNG in \\ndomestic waterways. Finally, oil use for electricity generation is already at relatively low levels \\nand is declining due to competition from gas and renewable electricity. Nevertheless, the faster \\ndisplacement of oil in this sector, compared to the one assumed in the Reference Case, is still \\npossible. \\nFigure 8.8 presents the cumulative effect of possible developments in various consumption sec\\n-tors under the APT Case over the forecast period. At the global level, oil demand in this case is \\nprojected to reach 103.8 mb/d in 2026, just 0.5 mb/d lower than in the Reference Case as the \\nimplementation of new policies and the penetration of more efficient technologies require some \\ntime to have a material impact. Even by 2030, oil demand in the APT case is projected to be only \\n1.4 mb/d lower than in the Reference Case.\\nFigure 8.8\\nDemand in the Reference Case and APT Case, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.8\\nmboe/d2045Reference CaseAPT Case85909510010511020192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045mb/d269\\nThe impact of technology and policies will be much more pronounced in the second part of the \\nforecast period. Indeed, the gap between the two cases widens to more than 5 mb/d in 2040 and \\nfurther to 8 mb/d in 2045 when demand in the APT Case falls below 100 mb/d.\\n8.3 Oil supply uncertainties\\nSimilar to the demand side, there are naturally also considerable uncertainties related to the oil \\nsupply side of the equation, as highlighted in previous WOOs. These uncertainties can be divided \\nboth in terms of time horizon Œ in the medium-term, the focus is rather on post-pandemic recov\\n-ery, and how resulting macroeconomic developments determine the oil market fundamentals and \\nrelated balances. In turn, oil producers™ and investors™ perceptions of these factors determine the \\noutlook for upstream investment.\\nIn the longer-term, while the global economy and fundamentals also play a role, uncertainties \\nrather relate to policy choices, including decisions with a more specific, if not immediate impact, \\nsuch as drilling bans, pipeline cancellations and the like. Moreover, the implications of the grad\\n-ual and increasingly widespread push towards the greater use of renewable energy sources Œ \\nwhat is often referred to as the energy transition Œ will become increasingly relevant. Closely \\nrelated to this is the potential impact of breakthroughs due to advancements in technology, and \\nthe related cost reductions.\\nFigure 8.9\\nLong-term non-OPEC supply sensitivities\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.9\\nmboe/d5759616365676971737520192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045Reference CaseLower Supply CaseHigher Supply Casemb/dAnother differentiation runs between US tight oil and other sources of non-OPEC liquids supply. \\nThe former is clearly one of the most price-sensitive supply components, and by its nature can \\nrespond more quickly to underlying changes in fundamentals, policy and technology Œ as seen for \\ninstance in the market downswing in 2014Œ2015, and a resulting decline in US tight oil in 2016. \\nThus, the sensitivity modelling underpinning the cases shown here indicates that US tight oil \\nresponds more quickly than other non-OPEC supply, and, therefore, has a greater impact on the \\nmedium-term outlook. Moreover, US tight oil is seen to be significantly more responsive in the \\nLower Supply Case, providing much more downside in the medium- and long-term. Conversely, \\n270\\nthe relative significance of the cumulative impact on sensitivity modelling for other non-OPEC \\nproduction sources is of greater significance in the long-term. \\nAccording to the sensitivity modelling, this results in potential upside and downside for non-OPEC \\nsupply in a range of nearly 7.5 mb/d in the medium-term and, given cumulative effects, nearly \\n10 mb/d by 2045. Importantly, the uncertainly is heavily skewed to the downside, with the poten\\n-tial shortfall in supply roughly double that of the potential upside (Figure 8.9). Naturally, any such \\nalternative outcomes to the Reference Case would have significant implications for oil market \\nbalances.\\nIn the Lower Supply Case, the main shortfall in oil production in the medium-term is expected \\nto be seen in US tight oil (Figure 8.10). Here, the assumption is that output declines rather than \\nrecovers in the next couple of years, as producers remain cautious or unable to invest in further \\ngrowth and prefer to continue to return funds to investors. Access to capital is also assumed to \\nbecome more difficult, with lenders increasingly hesitant to provide funding to what is seen to be \\nrisky and/or environmentally sensitive upstream enterprises. Additionally, policies adopted by the \\ncurrent US administration gain traction, including at least a partial ban on drilling and new lease \\nsales on federal lands, and possibly some tightening of environmental measures, including, for \\ninstance, methane emissions.\\nFigure 8.10\\nLong-term US tight oil sensitivities\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.10\\nmboe/d20459101112131415161720192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045Reference CaseLower Supply CaseHigher Supply Casemb/dMore generally, a prolonged macroeconomic recovery from the pandemic, assuming further \\nwaves of lockdowns, disruptions to supply chains, and as a result weaker oil demand, would give \\nrise to deteriorating market fundamentals.\\nOil supply in other non-OPEC countries would be affected more modestly in the medium-term, \\nas upstream projects already under development are assumed to go ahead, including nota\\n-bly some of the larger fields in Brazil, Guyana and Norway, among others. Here too, however, \\nsome of the more marginal and smaller upstream additions are assumed to be cancelled due \\nto uncertainty about the economics, leading to further underinvestment and lower supply \\n(Figure 8.11). \\n271\\nBeyond the medium-term, US tight oil is assumed to show a partial recovery in the latter part of the \\n2020s, in response to tightened fundamentals in the previous period, as supply falls short. However, \\nUS tight oil supply never again quite reaches pre-pandemic production levels of 11.7 mb/d seen in \\n2019. Production is sustained at a longer plateau than in the Reference Case, due to slower resource \\ndepletion. However, output also slows gradually from the late 2030s, declining to 10.4 mb/d by 2045. \\nIn other non-OPEC countries, by contrast, the cumulative effect of lower investment, less E&P \\nactivity, and fewer new upstream projects being signed off, means that the potential downside to \\nsupply expands over time. \\nFor instance, the Lower Supply Case assumes that beyond the first 3Œ4 projects already underway \\nin Guyana (or very likely to go ahead; plus a bit of organic growth), no new phases are signed off, \\ncapping capacity at around 0.7 mb/d. Incremental capacity additions from Canadian oil sands come \\nto a halt. Russian supply peaks around 2030, as longer-term, large new developments such as the \\npotentially massive Vostok Oil project essentially never really take off, and other, frontier Arctic \\ndevelopments, or deepwater Caspian, never materialize. Elsewhere, further growth assumed in \\nthe Reference Case, such as in Brazil or Kazakhstan, is capped from around 2025Œ2030. \\nMoreover, policy implications of decisions related to ESG concerns affect investment sentiment, as \\ndo moves towards boosting the use of renewable energy sources. Any specific measures, such as \\nwidespread CO\\n2 taxes, or even stricter regulations on emissions and other production-related pro\\n-cesses, would inevitably raise production costs, thereby potentially making some assets unprofit\\n-able to develop and off-limits. \\nIn sum, in the Lower Supply Case, total non-OPEC liquids is forecast to increase from the 2020 \\nbaseline of 62.9 mb/d to 65.2 mb/d in 2026, slightly lower than the pre-pandemic average of \\n 65.5 mb/d in 2019. After 2026, liquids supply would only increase very marginally to a plateau \\naround 65.5 mb/d in the latter part of the 2020s, before declining again to reach 59.3 mb/d in 2045. \\nIn the Higher Supply Case, the US tight oil outlook is for only relatively modest upside compared \\nto the Reference Case in the initial years of the medium-term period. The assumption is that \\nFigure 8.11\\nNon-OPEC liquids supply in the Lower Supply Case: deviation from the Reference Case\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.11\\nmboe/dŒ7.0Œ6.5Œ6.0Œ5.5Œ5.0Œ4.5Œ4.0Œ3.5Œ3.0Œ2.5Œ2.0Œ1.5Œ1.0Œ0.502021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045mb/dUSCanadaBrazilGuyanaRussiaKazakhstanChinaOther non-OPEC272\\nFigure 8.12\\nNon-OPEC liquids supply in the Higher Supply Case: deviation from the Reference Case\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 8.12\\nmboe/d204500.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.02021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045mb/dUSCanadaBrazilGuyanaRussiaKazakhstanChinaOther non-OPECthere is limited potential for upside (relative to the recovery trajectory projected in the Reference \\nCase, which assumes a healthy 1.7 mb/d cumulative increase in 2022/2023) even if market \\n fundamentals and producers™ appetite for investments were supportive. \\nThus in 2022/2023, upside is for some 200Œ300 tb/d. Only by 2024 does the higher production level \\nrelative to the Reference Case rise to 0.6 mb/d, before increasing to a more significant 1 mb/d by \\n2026, or 15.9 mb/d in absolute terms. This trajectory assumes that there are no obstacles to sig\\n-nificant investment into the US upstream, with market fundamentals such that producers can \\nboth return money to investors and still have ample funds to reinvest. \\nWith regard to other non-OPEC supply, this has the potential to pick up more quickly. All remain\\n-ing non-OPEC shut-in volumes are returned; upstream projects already underway are developed \\nwithout delays, as market fundamentals are supportive; incentives to increase investment are put \\nin place in key producing areas; and additional capacity increments are put on the drawing board. \\nBy 2024, upside potential is thus already 1 mb/d, and by 2026 it is at 1.15 mb/d, resulting in non-\\nOPEC liquids supply of 72.6 mb/d. \\nLooking to the long-term, US tight oil remains at a plateau of just over 16 mb/d, or around \\n 1 mb/d higher than the Reference Case, until the end of the decade. From the mid-2030s, output \\ndeclines again, to reach 14.6 mb/d in 2045. However, compared to the Reference Case trajectory, \\nthe decline takes place at a slower pace, as technology advances are assumed to keep production \\nbreak-evens low, ultimately unlocking more resources. Investment flows are ample and sufficient \\nto sustain these higher production levels. \\nIn other non-OPEC producers, the cumulative supply upside relative to the Reference Case rises \\nfrom 1.2 mb/d in 2026 to 2.5 mb/d in 2045 (Figure 8.12). Those producers already expected to pro\\n-vide most of the incremental Reference Case supply, such as Brazil, Guyana and Kazakhstan, are \\nassumed to bring on additional projects. Guyana™s total output, for example, is assumed to ulti\\n-mately reach a higher 2 mb/d, or around 50% above that in the Reference Case, as additional fields \\nare developed. Brazil meanwhile hits 6 mb/d in the long-term. \\n273\\nNorway, while not actually increasing its production after a medium-term peak, manages to suc\\n-cessfully slow its decline in the Higher Supply Case through a host of tie-backs and additional \\ndrilling. Countries with significant tight oil potential, such as Argentina, are seen to boost output. \\nIn Mexico too, onshore unconventional resources are finally developed in a meaningful way, and \\ndeepwater provinces are opened up. Russia is also assumed to put in place comprehensive tax \\nbreaks that incentivizes a full development of new areas, including the large and ambitious Vostok \\nOil project and perhaps other frontier areas.\\nIn absolute terms, this results in the Higher Supply Case for non-OPEC liquids expanding from \\n62.9 mb/d in 2020, to 72.6 mb/d in 2026, then to a peak of 73.4 mb/d around 2030, before declining \\nagain to 69.2 mb/d in 2045.\\n274\\nFocus on India\\n275Key takeaways\\nŁ India™s population will continue to expand and is expected to reach 1.62 billion by 2045, \\nadding around 241 million over the forecast period.\\nŁ India is forecast to continue growing at above 6% p.a. over the next one-and-a-half \\n decades.

It is projected that India™s population will continue to grow and reach 1.62 billion by 2045, \\nadding around 241 million to the world population during the period 2020Œ2045. This population \\ngrowth is quite remarkable and follows an addition of 416 million people over the previous 25-year \\nperiod from 1995Œ2020. To put this in further context, China™s population over the next 25 years is \\nprojected to remain fairly stable at a level of about 1.45 billion. These trends will mean that, dur\\n-ing the current decade, India is projected to surpass China to become the world™s most populous \\nnation, crossing the 1.5 billion mark. With approximately half of its population below the age of 25, \\nIndia is also a young nation. \\nWhile China™s working population is projected to decline in the coming decades, India™s working \\npopulation is expected to increase over the same period. By 2045, India is expected to have more \\nthan 1.1 billion working age people in the country. This rise reflects an increase of 179 million \\ncompared with the 2020 level of 928 million. Even today, 20% of the world™s working population \\nare in India.\\nThis growth is based on improved health facilities that has led to low infant mortality and higher \\nlife expectancy. However, it should be noted that government efforts and increasing education \\nlevels, especially among women, are slowing population growth. As a result, most Indian states \\nshould reach replacement fertility levels of 2.1 children per woman in the near future. According \\nto government estimates, the fertility rate in the country™s 22 major states is already at 2.2, and \\nin urban areas the rate has fallen below the replacement level to only 1.7 children per woman. \\n(The replacement fertility level is the number of children born per woman so that one generation \\nexactly replaces the preceding one.)\\nIndia™s population is expected to peak in around 2060 at about 1.65 billion and then start taper\\n-ing, with expectations for a decline to 1.45 billion by the end of this century. This will be the \\nBox 9.1\\nIndia™s Census 2021\\nIndia conducts its census every 10 years with the next one due in 2021. The 2021 census is \\nthe 16th the country has undertaken and the 8th since independence, and for the first time \\nit will be a ‚digital census™ with a mobile app used to collect data. The use of new technology \\nwill make census data more quickly available to policymakers. This year™s census will be the \\nworld™s largest enumeration exercise. India™s previous census was carried out in 2011, when \\nthe country™s population stood at 1.21 billion. \\nThe enormity of the exercise can be gauged by the fact that a total of 3.3 million enumera\\n-tors Œ persons who conduct door-to-door counting Œ will be mobilized for data collection. \\nThe exercise will be done in 16 languages to facilitate the proper filing of accurate details. \\nThe exercise will be conducted in two phases Œ House Listing and Housing Census and \\nPopulation Enumeration. The government has allocated Rs 3,768 crore ($490 million) for \\nthe census in the budget. The census will not only count people, but also undertake a com\\n-prehensive demographic study. Thirty-one questions will be asked, including questions on \\nenergy usage and shifts to cleaner energy.\\n277\\noutcome of faster urbanization and improving education levels, as a result of progressive \\n government policies.\\nStatus of urbanization in India\\nUrbanization represents a social transformation from traditional rural societies to modern urban \\ncommunities. In India, there is a long tradition of urbanization dating back 5,000 years, when the \\nIndus Valley civilization saw one of the earliest urban settlements in human history. Urbanization \\nis not just an indicator of societal development, but key to population management. Countries \\nand societies with higher urbanization rates, along with better education and health care, have \\nlower fertility rates and often better standards of living for their population. India™s regional pop\\n-ulation statistics confirm this. The states with the highest fertility rates Œ Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, \\nJharkhand, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh Œ are less urbanized. Fertility rate declines have been \\nsignificant in India™s urban areas, where both parents are educated, and the age for marriage has \\nrisen.There are approximately 3,700 urban local bodies with 100 corporations, 1,500 municipal coun\\n-cils and 2,100 Nagar panchayats (Notified Area Councils), besides 56 cantonment boards (under \\nthe Ministry of Defence) in India. The country is home to many of the world™s most populous cit\\n-ies, making India the place with the largest urban agglomerations globally, although its over\\n-all urbanization, until recently, has been building slowly. Only around 34% of India™s population \\nlives in urban areas, a significantly lower figure than in other developing countries. For example, \\nurbanization levels reach up to 50% in China.\\nWith many policy interventions in recent years, urbanization is set to rise considerably in the com\\n-ing decades. To promote urbanization at a faster pace, the government started the ‚Smart Cities \\nMission™ initiatives for 100 cities in 2015. There are various other schemes for the poor like the \\nflagship Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Œ Urban (Prime Minister Residence Scheme - Urban) Œ to \\npromote and provide housing for the urban poor. The scheme addresses the urban housing short\\n-age among indigent categories of city dwellers, including slum dwellers, by ensuring a ‚pucca™ \\n(permanent) house is available to all eligible urban households by 2022, when the nation reaches \\n75 years of independence. \\nThe government has also initiated affordable rental housing complexes, on the back of the reverse \\nmigration of many urban migrants due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This initiative will make it eas\\n-ier for urban migrants and the poor in the industrial sector, as well as in the non-formal urban \\neconomy, to have access to dignified and affordable rental housing close to workplaces. Various \\nother programmes also aim to improve urbanization. The urbanization momentum is projected \\nto pick up, with many large cities also adapting rapid transport metro systems as part of the \\n development of high-quality, inter-city expressways.\\nDemographic dividend in India\\nIndia is a young country with a large working age population that is set to grow further in the com\\n-ing decades. This gives the country an edge over other developing and developed nations, where \\nthis advantage is now declining in comparison. This demographic dividend can help accelerate the \\npace of economic growth and the country™s demographic profile is subject to growth through five \\ndistinct forces. \\nThe demographic advantage began for India in recent years and is projected to last for the next \\nfour decades, translating into the world™s largest labour force to support its development. The \\ndemographic advantage does not only come from a gradual population rise, but also through more \\nwomen joining the workforce. The large workforce is supported by improving health and education \\ninfrastructure, as well as technological innovation. \\n278\\nThe Indian government is aware of this enormous advantage and is keen to provide the best demo\\n-graphic dividend. Launched in 2015, ‚Skill India Mission™ aims to identify and enable a strong skill \\ndevelopment system. Skill enhancement and training for the acquisition of these skills is the focus \\nof educational and employment programmes. Moreover, there are other programmes that sup\\n-port entrepreneur skills through start-up initiatives to create self-employment opportunities and \\nemployment for others.\\n9.2 Economic developments\\nThe Indian economy is notable for its resilience. In the past, India was able to resist downturns \\nand recover quickly. All economic projections show confidence about its prospects to accomplish \\nnearly double-digit growth among major economies in 2021. This does not only offset precipitated \\nCOVID-19 losses from last year, but puts the country in a net gain position. \\nThe Ministry of Finance™s ‚Economic Survey 2021™ notes that, learning from the Spanish flu expe\\n-rience, India implemented an early and stringent lockdown from late March to May 2020 to curb \\nthe pace of the spread of COVID-19. With the economy brought to a standstill for two months, the \\ninevitable effect was a 23.9% GDP contraction compared with the previous year™s second quar\\n-ter. This contraction was consistent with the stringency of the lockdown. This economic suffer\\n-ing came at the comparatively better and much praised management of the first wave of the \\npandemic. The Indian economy showed early signs of recovery with a modest 0.4% growth in the  \\n4Q20 and 1.6 % in the following quarter (January-March) of 2021. \\nAs further detailed in the ‚Economic Survey 2021™, the fiscal policy response of the Indian govern\\n-ment to the pandemic was strategized using a step-by-step approach. During the first two quar\\n-ters of the 2020Œ2021 fiscal year, the government ensured that funds for essential activities were \\navailable despite a sharp contraction in revenue receipts. The initial approach was to provide a \\ncushion for the poorer sections of society and the business sector (especially medium and small \\nenterprises) to tide over the distress caused by the economic disruption. \\nFigure 9.1\\nGDP growth rates in selected regions\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 9.1\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n2045Œ8Œ6Œ4Œ202468101220192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045% p.a.IndiaChinaOther AsiaMiddle East & AfricaWorld279\\nThis included government measures such as the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) \\nscheme for ensuring food security through the public distribution system, with direct benefit \\ntransfers to widows, pensioners and women, additional funds for the Mahatma Gandhi National \\nRural Employment Guarantee Scheme and debt moratoria and liquidity support for businesses. \\nWith the easing of mobility and health-related restrictions in the third quarter, the govern\\n-ment transited in a calibrated fashion to support investment and consumption demand. The \\neconomic recovery has gained momentum since the 1Q21. Unfortunately, the second COVID-19 \\nwave, including virus mutations, struck India hard at a time when the economy was looking for \\nupside momentum in all sectors ranging from manufacturing to tourism. \\nIn June 2021, India™s Finance Minister announced a slew of measures to provide relief to diverse \\nsectors affected by the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures announced \\nwere also aimed to prepare the health system for emergency response and provide impetus \\nfor growth and employment. A total of 17 measures amounting to $84 billion were announced. \\nMost of these schemes focused on providing economic relief to people and businesses affected \\nby the pandemic. \\nThere has been a special focus on health and reviving the travel and tourism sectors. Earlier, \\nthe country™s Union Budget had evidently energized the Indian economy through various short-, \\nmedium- and long-term measures. The 2021Œ2022 budget targeted capital expenditure for the fis\\n-cal year 2022 at $75.81 billion, an increase of 34.5% over the previous fiscal year. Higher government \\nexpenditure, along with proactive encouragement and policy support, will help boost the economy.\\nDespite these setbacks, India is expected to grow at almost double-digit figures of 9.5% in 2021 \\nagainst the world average of 5.5%. Beyond this, as presented in Figure 9.1, India is expected to \\ncontinue growing at above 6% over the next one-and-a-half decades, while other developing coun\\n-tries will hover around 3Œ4%. India™s economic growth rate will continue to be above global GDP \\ngrowth rates by a margin of more than 2% until 2045. As a result of this impressive growth, India \\nis set to account for almost 14.4% of global GDP in 2045 (Figure 9.2). \\nFigure 9.2\\nShare of India™s economy in global GDP\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 9.2\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n0246810121416202020252030203520402045% 280\\nVaccine for the economy \\nWhile India has announced various stimulus packages to support the economy, it recognizes that \\nthe COVID-19 vaccination is crucial to reinvigorating the engines of economic growth. Accordingly, \\nthe government announced a new policy for a fresh phase of universal COVID-19 vaccinations \\nstarting on 21 June 2021. India has shifted to the centralized procurement of vaccines, realizing \\nthe need to accelerate vaccinations. As per India™s demographic distribution, 865 million people, \\nor 63.1% of the population, is above 18 years of age. Assuming herd immunity at 80%, the popula\\n-tion to be vaccinated is around 700 million. The focus is on the use of technology to ease vaccine \\nadministration to enhance faster coverage. In fact, India™s vaccine management portal ‚CoWin™ has \\nfound favours from various countries that are also keen to use it. The desire of India to help the \\nworld community is an extension of its earlier Vaccine Maitri to provide COVID-19 vaccines to more \\nthan 90 countries around the world. \\n9.3 Primary energy demand\\nIndia is the third-largest energy consumer in the world and its primary energy demand is poised \\nto grow at an average rate of 3.1% p.a. over the period 2020Œ2045 (Table 9.1), compared with a \\n0.9% p.a. average global growth rate. India™s primary energy demand more than doubled from \\n2000Œ2019, before slowing temporarily in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. \\nIndia™s energy demand is already expected to reach a pre-pandemic high in 2021 and will continue \\nits growth trajectory throughout the projection period. India™s per capita energy consumption is \\nexpected to almost double from 4.65 boe in 2020 to 8.56 boe in 2045, on the back of the fastest-\\ngrowing major economy. \\nTable 9.1\\nIndia primary energy demand by fuel type, 2020Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nLevels\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\nmboe/d\\nGrowth\\n% p.a.\\nFuel share\\n%2020202520302035204020452020Œ20452020Œ204520202045Oil\\n4.4\\n5.8\\n7.1\\n8.4\\n9.7\\n10.8\\n6.4\\n3.7\\n25.2\\n28.6\\nCoal\\n7.6\\n9.4\\n10.9\\n12.4\\n13.4\\n13.8\\n6.1\\n2.4\\n43.7\\n36.3\\nGas\\n1.0\\n1.5\\n2.0\\n2.6\\n3.2\\n3.8\\n2.85.4\\n5.9\\n10.1\\nNuclear\\n0.2\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.8\\n1.0\\n1.3\\n1.0\\n6.8\\n1.4\\n3.4\\nHydro\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n0.4\\n0.5\\n0.5\\n0.60.3\\n3.0\\n1.6\\n1.6\\nBiomass\\n3.6\\n3.7\\n3.8\\n3.9\\n3.9\\n4.0\\n0.3\\n0.4\\n20.7\\n10.4\\nOther renewables\\n0.3\\n0.61.0\\n1.7\\n2.5\\n3.6\\n3.4\\n11.1\\n1.5\\n9.6\\nTotal\\n17.5\\n21.7\\n25.8\\n30.3\\n34.3\\n37.9\\n20.4\\n3.1\\n100.0\\n100.0\\nLooking at India™s energy mix (Figure 9.3), the highest growth rate between 2020 and 2045 of just \\nover 11% will be for other renewables, in line with the emphasis on efforts related to reducing \\ncarbon emissions and increasing ‚green™ energy. The share of coal in primary energy demand \\nis expected to come down from the existing level of 43.5% to 36.3% in 2045, but it would still be \\nthe highest level of all energy sources by 2045. Oil is expected to constitute 28.6% in the primary \\nenergy mix in 2045, an increase of more than 3 pp compared to 2020. \\n281\\nBiomass currently provides more than 20% of India™s energy demand, but that is set to drop to \\nabout 10% in 2045 due to the various policy interventions of the Indian government. Currently, \\nIndia™s energy mix is primarily dominated by fossil fuels which contribute 75% of India™s energy \\ndemand. This level is expected to be the same in 2045, with natural gas increasing from around a \\n6% share to over 10% by 2045.\\nOverall, the Indian government™s ambitious push towards clean energy will increase the share \\nof other renewables from around 1% in 2019 to almost 10% in 2045. By comparison, during the \\n2000Œ2019 period, Indian energy demand growth was led by coal and oil, which accounted for \\nmore than 80% of new energy demand. In contrast, during the 2020Œ2045 period, energy sources \\nother than oil and coal will increasingly play a significant role, accounting for nearly 40% of the \\nenergy demand growth. \\nThe average growth rate of India™s total primary energy demand has increased from 2.8% in last \\nyear™s WOO projections (2019Œ2045) to 3.1% in the current projections (2020Œ2045). However, total \\nenergy demand in 2045 has dropped to 38 mboe/d in the current projection from the last year™s \\nestimate of 38.8 mboe/d. This is explained by a lower base in 2020 of 17.6 mboe/d due to the \\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary energy demand during the two waves. India™s energy \\ndemand by fuel can be viewed in Figure 9.4.\\nSupply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the adoption of \\nnon-fossil fuels. In the WOO 2020, it was estimated that coal would have a share of 42.7% in the \\nIndian energy mix by 2045, but this has now been revised down to 36.2%, albeit still largest con\\n-tributor to India™ energy mix throughout the outlook period. Nevertheless, coal™s average annual \\ndemand growth is estimated at 2.4%, much slower relative to most other fuels in the mix. Coal is \\nmainly used by three sectors in India Œ electricity generation, cement production and the iron and \\nsteel industry. These three sectors are key drivers of India™s economic growth. At the same time, \\ngrowth in coal consumption will be moderated due to climate commitments made by India, within \\nFigure 9.3\\nStructure of the energy mix in India\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 9.3\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n0204060801002019202020252030203520402045%CoalGasNuclearBiomassHydroOilOther renewables282\\nthe framework of the Paris Agreement, environmental issues, and the declining costs of renewa\\n-bles, such as solar PV. \\nThe Indian Central Electricity Authority prepares the country™s National Electricity Plan in \\naccordance with the National Electricity Policy. The 2018 Plan outlines that 23 GW of coal-fired \\ncapacity is set to retire during the 2017Œ2022 period and another 26 GW during the 2022Œ2027 \\ntimeframe. The Indian government is aiming to replace old coal-fired thermal units with gas, \\nhydro, nuclear and renewables. This will further systemically reduce the importance of coal in \\nIndia™s energy mix. \\nOil remains crucial to India and the second largest provider of energy to the country. Between 2000 \\nand 2020 India™s oil demand doubled to 4.5 mboe/d. With the expected strong growth in future \\noil demand, set alongside stagnant domestic production, India has become more reliant on oil \\nimports, which were more than 80% of demand in 2018. The government has taken many steps to \\nreduce India™s oil imports, but due to inherent time lags in the final production of oil and gas from \\ndomestic fields, this may take some time to reach fruition.\\nIndia™s current gas consumption is at close to 6% of the energy mix, but the adoption of gas is ris\\n-ing at a fast pace. During the projection period, it is expected that gas consumption will grow by \\n5.4% p.a. outpacing total energy demand growth. Currently, residential consumption of natural \\ngas is small, but India is expanding its CGD network quickly. India aims to increase its natural gas \\nshare to 15% of the energy mix by 2030, a target higher than the WOO 2021 projections. The Indian \\ngovernment is focused on a more gas-based economy, as well as rapidly expanding its gas grid \\nand LNG import infrastructure. \\nThe Indian Government stated in its commitment to meet the Paris Agreement that its NDCs \\naims for 40% of its installed electricity capacity to be from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. By \\n2027, India aims to have 275 GW of installed solar and wind capacity, 72 GW of hydro and 15 GW \\nof nuclear power that would make up 56.5% of its installed electricity capacity, taking India above \\nits NDCs target. \\nFigure 9.4\\nPrimary energy demand in India\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 9.4\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n05101520253035401971197419771980198319861989199219951998200120042007201020132016201920222025202820312034203720402043mboe/dCoalGasNuclearBiomassHydroOilOther renewables283\\nIndia has an ambitious objective to reach 63 GW of nuclear power capacity by 2032, a multi-fold \\nincrease compared to current installed capacity of around 7 GW.

This will improve the economic via\\n-bility of hydropower projects.\\nBiomass is expected to witness the slowest growth among all primary fuels in India™s energy mix. \\nIndia has been successful in reducing dependence on biomass with its share in the energy mix \\ndeclining from 63% in 1971 to around 21% in 2020. Going forward, the share of biomass is pro\\n-jected to drop further to 10% by 2045. This change is catalyzed due to the higher penetration of \\nLPG in rural India. The government™s flagship Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojna (PMUY) scheme has \\npushed LPG usage in rural areas for cooking purposes, displacing biomass. To date, more than \\n 80 million LPG connections have been distributed under PMUY, which has significantly reduced \\nthe share of less energy efficient biomass from the energy mix.\\nOn 10 August 2021, Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi launched the second phase of PMUY \\n(2.0) to provide LPG connections to 10 million more households living below the poverty line. \\nOverall, the consumption of biomass in India is projected to increase to 4 mboe/d in 2045 \\nfrom the current 3.6 mboe/d, but this additional demand comes from biofuels, biomass use \\nfor electricity generation and other bioenergy use, with reduced biomass consumption as a \\n traditional fuel. \\nOver the projection period, other renewables (especially solar and wind) have the highest growth \\nof 11% p.a., which is aided by the Indian government™s policy and vision towards cleaner and sus\\n-tainable energy. India has ambitious plans to expand the use of renewables to meet demand \\ngrowth for electricity in the industrial, residential and service sectors and to help the country cut \\nits heavy dependence on coal. \\nIn April 2021, the Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Modi, approved the implementation of the \\nProduction Linked Incentive scheme Œ ‚National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules™ \\nŒ focused on achieving manufacturing GW-scale capacity in high efficiency solar PV modules with \\nan outlay of $600 million. Solar capacity additions presently depend largely on imported solar PV \\ncells and modules as the domestic manufacturing industry has limited operational capacities for \\nsolar PV cells and modules. \\nThe National Programme on High Efficiency Solar PV Modules will reduce import dependence in \\na strategic sector like electricity. The benefits expected from the scheme include an additional \\n10 GW capacity of integrated solar PV manufacturing plants and direct investment of around \\n $2.3 billion in solar PV manufacturing projects. \\nIndia has the fifth highest installed wind capacity in the world with 39.4 GW (May 2021), and a tar\\n-get of 60 GW by 2022. Wind energy constitutes 41.5% of India™s renewable energy basket.\\nTo summarize, Indian energy demand is anticipated to be the fastest growing among all major \\neconomies, in line with its strong GDP growth. Its commitment to a cleaner, renewable and more \\nefficient energy mix will result in energy sources such as gas, nuclear and other renewables \\n having greater shares in the country™s future energy mix.\\n284\\n9.4\\n India™s energy policies, climate change and sustainable\\n developmentIndia accounts for around 18% of the world™s population, but uses only around 7% of the world™s \\nprimary energy. India™s per capita energy consumption equates to 4.7 boe, compared to the global \\nper capita average of 13.2 boe. \\nIndia has made huge strides in four key areas to ensure full access to electricity. It has helped \\nbring power to more than 700 million people through its village electrification programme, the \\nDeen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY); given access to clean cooking fuel to every \\nhousehold in the country through its LPG distribution programme, the PMUY; boosted energy effi\\n-ciency through innovative programmes, such as replacing incandescent light bulbs with LEDs \\n(under the Ujala scheme); and, lastly through a huge sustainability push on renewable energy \\ncapacity additions and taking appropriate steps for a ‚gas-based economy™. \\nIndia™s energy policy has seven key pillars:\\n1. Accelerating efforts to move towards a gas-based economy;\\n2. Cleaner use of fossil fuels, particularly petroleum and coal;\\n3. Greater reliance on domestic sources to drive biofuels;\\n4. Achieving the renewables target of 450 GW by 2030;\\n5. Increasing the contribution of electricity to de-carbonize mobility;\\n6. Moving into emerging fuels, including hydrogen; and\\n7. Digital innovation across all energy systems.\\n9.4.1 Gas based economy\\nAs already noted, India™s share of natural gas in its primary energy mix is about 6% and projec\\n-tions show that by 2045 this could rise to above 10%. However, India is making stringent efforts to \\nincrease this share to 15% by 2030. \\nThe three main sectors consuming natural gas are fertilisers (30%), power (20%) and city gas \\nentities (20%), the latter for both domestic and transportation demand. Other important sectors \\nare petrochemicals and refineries for feedstock and energy usage. On the production side, India \\n currently imports more than 50% of its gas needs in the form of LNG. \\nGas demand is expected to increase to about 450 million standard cubic meters per day \\n(msm3/d) from the current level of about 150 msm\\n3/d through the expansion of the country™s \\ngas grid to various industries like fertilisers, refineries, petrochemicals and iron and steel in \\nthe coming years. Domestic and transportation natural gas consumption itself is expected \\nto expand to 135 msm\\n3/d by 2030 on the back of the establishment of 10,000 CNG stations \\nand with domestic piped natural gas (PNG) used for cooking covering most areas. As part \\nof India™s Union Budget 2021/22, 100 more districts will be added to the CGD network in the \\nnext three years, which involves the participation of private domestic companies, as well as \\nforeign players setting up infrastructure for the distribution of PNG and CNG fuels to the \\n domestic market.\\nCGD networks for various districts and geographical areas are auctioned off in a competitive bid\\n-ding process. With the completion of the 10th bidding round, CGD would be available in 228 geo\\n-graphical areas, comprising 406 districts spread over 27 states and union territories that cover \\napproximately 70% of India™s population and 53% of its geographical area.\\nGas demand in the power sector is also projected to rise to 45 msm\\n3/d by 2030, especially for \\npeaking and balancing requirements for power plants based on renewable energy. \\n285\\nThe Indian government has brought in natural gas marketing reforms to increase the domestic \\nproduction of natural gas and to bring uniformity to the market price discovery of gas. The initia\\n-tives would give greater marketing freedom in the sale of natural gas through e-bidding. India™s \\nfirst automated national-level gas trading platform was launched in June 2020, which prescribes \\nstandard procedures to discover the market price of gas. \\n9.4.2 Cleaner use of fossil fuels\\nBesides the actions taken by India for the enhancement of natural gas in the primary energy \\nmix, many other interventions are also leading to less carbon emissions alongside fossil fuel \\nusage. \\nThe Indian government has kick-started the use of clean coal technology to help deliver negligi\\n-ble sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide and free particulate emissions compared to direct coal fired pro\\n-cesses, by reviving an erstwhile closed fertilizer plant at the Talcher producing urea, which has an \\ninstalled capacity of 1.27 million metric tonnes p.a. \\nThe transportation sector has also seen policies geared towards reducing emissions through \\ntightening fuel specifications. India leapfrogged from Bharat Stage IV (Euro IV equivalent) to \\nBharat Stage VI (Euro VI equivalent) emission standards nationwide in April 2020, for both light-\\nduty and heavy-duty vehicles. The 10 parts per million (ppm) limit in Bharat Stage VI is much lower \\nthan the previous sulphur limit of 50 ppm.\\nIn terms of fuel efficiency, passenger vehicle fuel economy standards are measured on a corporate \\naverage fleet-wide basis, much as in the US. Fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles were set \\nin 2015 with one set of coefficients in the standard-setting formula adopted for the fiscal years through \\nto 2021Œ2022, and a second, more stringent set adopted for fiscal years 2022Œ2023 and onwards. \\nHeavy-duty vehicle economy standards were set in 2017 and light commercial vehicles standards \\nwere set in 2019, with the consumption targets defined by specific equations for different categories \\nbased on weight. The standard for light commercial vehicles became effective in April 2020.\\nAfter the implementation of IMO 2020 on 1 January 2020, which limits the sulphur in fuel oil used \\nfor ships operating outside designated ECAS to 0.5%, Indian refineries are consistently supplying \\nbunker fuel of VLSFO grade.\\nFrom January 2020, the specification for kerosene has been tightened to 1,000 ppm (0.1 % wt) \\nsulphur for all grades. Also, PNG/LPG has replaced kerosene in a very big way as a household \\ncooking fuel. This has had a positive impact on indoor air pollution and the health of women, \\n particularly in rural areas.\\n9.4.3 BiofuelsThe Expert Group (June 2021) on the ‚Roadmap for Ethanol blending in India 2020Œ25™ noted that \\nabout 98% of the fuel requirements in India™s road transportation sector is currently met by fossil \\nfuels, and the remaining 2% by biofuels. Domestic biofuels provide a strategic opportunity for the \\ncountry, as they enable India to reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels. \\nEthanol is one of the principal biofuels, which is produced by the fermentation of sugars by yeasts, \\nor via petrochemical processes, such as ethylene hydration. The National Policy on Biofuels \\n(2018), provided an indicative target of 20% ethanol blending under the Ethanol Blended Petrol \\n(EBP) Programme by 2030, which has now been brought forward to 2025. Currently, gasoline with \\na 10% ethanol blend (E10) is being retailed in India, wherever it is available. However, given that \\nsufficient ethanol is not available, only around 50% of the petrol sold is E10 blended, while the \\nremaining is unblended petrol (E0). \\n286\\nThe current average level of annual ethanol blending in the country is 5% (2019Œ2020), although it \\nreached about 9% in the second quarter of 2021. The step to E10, along with achieving the higher \\nE20 targets, will require nationwide standardization and the adoption of emission standards. As \\nper the ‚Gazette Notification™ issued on 2 June 2021, oil companies are required to sell EBP with \\na percentage of ethanol up to 20% as per Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) specifications in all \\nstates and union territories. This notification shall come into force with effect from the 1 April \\n2023. The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has greenlighted the use of E20 Œ a blend of \\n20% ethanol and 80% gasoline Œ as an automotive fuel. Mass emission standards for the use of \\nE20 have also been notified in the Central Motor Vehicles (Fourth Amendment) Rules (2021), which \\ncame into force on 8 March 2021. According to the notification, hydrogen-enriched CNG can also \\nbe used as an automotive fuel. \\nThe government aims to set up distilleries to produce first generation ethanol from feedstocks, \\nsuch as cereals (rice, wheat, barley, corn, and sorghum), sugar cane, and sugar beet. The govern\\n-ment plans to assist units for the conversion of molasses-based distilleries to dual feedstock, in \\norder to increase the availability of biofuels. This policy also envisages blending of diesel with 5% \\nof biodiesel. Recognizing the potential benefits of biofuels in aviation, its development and deployment in this \\nsector is being studied. A flight was demonstrated in August 2018 from Dehradun to New Delhi \\nusing a biofuel developed by the Indian Institute of Petroleum, a Council of Scientific & Industrial \\nResearch laboratory. The BIS has already developed the specifications for use on a regular basis \\nfor commercial flights. \\n9.4.4 Renewables \\nAs detailed in the book ‚\\nAccelerating Citizen Centric Energy Transition - The India Story\\n™ issued by \\nthe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy in June 2021, India declared in 2015 a target of 100 GW \\nof installed solar energy capacity by 2022, quintupling the National Solar Mission™s (NSM) earlier \\ntarget to install 20 GW solar capacity by 2022. The 100 GW target included 60 GW from utility-scale \\nplants and 40 GW from rooftop systems. \\nMajor initiatives to promote the development and deployment of solar energy include the Solar \\nPark Scheme to build solar parks and ultra-mega solar power projects with a target capacity of \\n40 GW by 2022; the Roof Top Solar Programme to accelerate the deployment of rooftop systems; \\nthe Production Linked Incentive scheme to catalyze domestic manufacturing capacity for high effi\\n-ciency solar cells and modules; 100% FDI through the Automatic Route; the Suryamitra (friend of \\nthe Sun) Skill Development Programme to skill solar maintenance and service technicians; and \\nthe PM-KUSUM scheme to use solar for agricultural pumps. \\nAs part of the country™s current fiscal budget 2021/22, $400 million of additional capital will be \\ninfused into the Solar Energy Corporation of India and more than $2 billion to the Indian Renewable \\nEnergy Development Agency, to help achieve the country™s ambitious target of 450 GW of installed \\nrenewable energy capacity by 2030. \\n The Indian solar market is the third largest in the world. During 2015Œ2019, solar electricity gen\\n-eration in India expanded by 50%. India™s leadership of the International Solar Alliance and the \\ndedicated Central Public Sector Undertaking Solar Energy Corporation of India also provide a \\n geopolitical and institutional boost to this growing sector. \\nIndia is also a leading global wind turbine manufacturer for sizes ranging from 225 kW to 3.6 meg\\n-awatt (MW), with proven technologies to harness low and medium wind flows at hub heights up \\nto 140 metres and rotor sizes up to 145 metres. India also exports turbines and components to \\nAustralia, Brazil, Asia, Europe and the US.\\n287\\nSingle location solar-wind hybrid projects are also being set up to optimize land use and man\\n-age the inherent intermittency of renewable power. India™s first large scale-solar-wind pro\\n-ject, located at Kavithal in Karnataka, combines a 50 MW wind farm and a 28 MW solar PV \\nplant. \\n9.4.5 Electrification \\nThe DDUGJY was launched in 2014 by the Ministry of Power to achieve universal village elec\\n-trification and enable continuous power supply to rural India. It entails an investment of \\n $5.9 billion. The focus included electrifying 18,542 un-electrified villages, improving electri\\n-fication in those that had, and the provision of free electricity connections to a further four \\nmillion poor households by May 2018. Village electrification has played a significant role in \\ncurbing the use of polluting fuels like kerosene and diesel in rural areas. The DDUGJY is com\\n-plemented by another flagship programme, the SAUBHAGYA, under which 28 million house\\n-holds were to be provided free or subsidized electricity connections.\\nElectric vehicles\\nIndia has been incentivizing the use of electricity in mobility through the implementation of its \\nscheme titled ‚Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles™ (FAME), with the passing \\nof subsidies directly to the original equipment manufacturer. In Phase II of the three-year pro\\n-gramme up to 2021Œ2022, with an outlay of around $1.4 billion, the government is offering upfront \\nincentives to purchase EVs, as well as establishing the necessary charging infrastructure. \\nTwo and three wheelers dominate India™s road transport fleet, but only consume about 20% of the \\ntotal energy demand in the transport sector. Recently the subsidy on two-wheeler EVs has been \\nBox 9.2\\nElectric vehicles in India\\nIn March 2018, the government of India announced its goal of reaching 30% EV penetration \\nby 2030. This is in pursuit of India™s commitment to reduce its GHG emissions intensity by \\n33% to 35% by 2030 below 2005 levels. \\nIndia is member of the multi-government policy forum titled the Electric Vehicle Initiative, \\nwhich was launched at the Clean Energy Ministerial. This promotes the adoption of EVs \\nworldwide. India has also endorsed the ‚EV 30\\n@30™ campaign launched by the CEM, which \\nhas a set goal to reach a share of 30% EV sales by 2030.\\nThe Indian government has boosted the adoption of EVs through the implementation of the \\nFAME schemes (I and II). Through various policies. India is incentivizing three main components \\nof the EV ecosystem Œ demand generation, charging infrastructure and industrial development. \\nUnder the FAME II scheme, the government has allocated $1.4 billion for 1.6 million hybrid and \\nEVs, and includes measures to promote the domestic manufacturing of EVs and their parts.\\nTo promote demand for EVs, incentives such as purchase subsidies, tax exemptions, \\naccess to financing, scrapping & retrofit incentives, priority permits, green zones, parking \\n incentives and toll fee waivers are granted via central or state policies. \\n288\\nFAME II also allocated $133 million for expanding charging infrastructure. Under this allo\\n-cation, the Ministry of Heavy Industries invited Expression of Interest to install a minimum \\nof one charging station every 25 km along key highways and every 100 km to accommodate \\nheavy duty vehicles. To further develop charging infrastructure, incentives such as capital \\nsubsidy, concessional land provision, concessional EV tariffs, the use of renewable energy \\nsources and the relaxation of development control regulations are provided. \\nThe government has also offered performance link incentives for battery sectors to aid \\nthe adoption of EVs. Further capital and interest subsidies, tax exemptions, land devel\\n-opment incentives, battery recycling initiatives, employment incentives, skill develop\\n-ment, along with R&D initiatives, are some key actions taken to promote the industrial \\n development of EVs. \\nTo further accelerate the adoption of EVs, the Indian government has tasked state govern\\n-ments and local authorities to enable the transition to EVs. Currently a total of 14 states have \\nnotified or have drafted EV policies in place.\\nincreased further to $260/KW with a cap of 40% on the vehicle cost. In the three-wheeler & four-\\nwheeler segment, the incentives are mainly applicable to vehicles registered and used for pub\\n-lic transport. It further aims to establish charging stations at 25 km intervals on both sides of all \\nmajor highways across the country.\\n9.4.6 Emerging fuels (hydrogen) \\nIndia™s foray into hydrogen technologies began in 2005 with the National Hydrogen Energy \\nRoadmap, with several technologies developed and demonstrated in the period since. In the \\ndownstream, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas is set to augment India™s hydrogen supply \\nchain infrastructure and business models.\\nThe government has supported the use of hydrogen energy and its use as a fuel, which has been \\ninstrumental in the development and demonstration of internal combustion engines, two wheel\\n-ers, three wheelers, and mini buses that run on hydrogen fuel. Two hydrogen refuelling stations \\nhave also been established (one each at the Indian Oil R&D Centre, Faridabad, and the National \\nInstitute of Solar Energy, Gurugram). In a major thrust for hydrogen energy, the country™s largest \\nprivate player in the hydrocarbon sector, Reliance Industries, has announced the setting up of a \\ngreen hydrogen production unit at its Jamnagar facility.\\nIndia has looked to further jump-start the development of its hydrogen ecosystem with the \\nannouncement of the National Hydrogen Energy Mission (NHEM) in the Union Budget 2021. The \\naim is to make India a global manufacturing hub for hydrogen and fuel cell technologies across \\nthe entire value chain. Hydrogen can serve as a transport fuel, an input to refineries, and as a \\nsource of heat and power for a wide range of sectors, such as chemicals, iron and steel, ferti\\n-lisers and petroleum. This versatility, combined with a low-carbon footprint, makes hydrogen a \\nstrategic choice for India™s energy mix. It can be stored and transported in pressurized, liquefied \\nform, and can be used for power-to-gas, power-to-power, power-to-mobility and vehicle-to-grid \\napplications. \\nIn a push for India™s energy security, Prime Minister Modi in his Independence Day speech on 15 \\nAugust 2021 announced the NHEM for the country. Green hydrogen, produced by splitting water \\ninto hydrogen and oxygen, using electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind and solar \\ncan be a game changer for India. \\n289Stressing on the need for energy independence, while announcing the mission, Prime Minister Modi \\nsaid that the plan involves India becoming a global hub for green hydrogen production and exports.\\n9.4.7 Digitalization of the energy consuming processes\\nAs per the report of the Task Force on Digitalization in Energy (September 2020), which was estab\\n-lished by the Committee on Sustainable Energy of UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), \\ndigitalization is an emerging trend that is revamping the energy landscape and enabling progress \\ntoward continuous energy efficiency improvements. In fact, energy efficiency is at the core of the \\nenergy system. As per the report, technologies and digital innovations facilitating new market \\nopportunities include: AI, block chain, machine learning, advanced data analytics, IoT, big data, \\ncloud computing, sensors, automation, 3D printing and robotics. The focus is on establishing new \\nbusiness models that enable the generation, delivery and consumption of energy in an ever more \\nsustainable manner.\\nThe Union Government set up the National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM) in 2015 as an institutional \\nmechanism to accelerate smart grid deployment in India. The NSGM facilitates technology, policy, \\nand training to promote smart grids at the distribution level. The focus of the NSGM is to lower \\naggregate technical and commercial losses and power purchase costs; manage peak loads; and \\nimprove the quality of grid visibility, asset management, renewable power integration, and ser\\n-vices, like net-metering. Under this initiative, the Ministry of Power aims to replace 250 million \\nconventional meters with prepaid smart meters over the coming 3Œ5 years.\\nThe smart meter, which is the main component of advanced metering infrastructure, enables \\naccurate energy audits, reduces utilities™ commercial losses, enhances revenues, and allows con\\n-sumers to track and adjust usage. The transparency and trust enabled by smart meters is an \\nimportant tool for providing 24x7 quality power for all. \\nIn 2015, the Union Government launched the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY). One of the pri\\n-orities of this scheme was the installation of smart meters for all customers with a monthly con\\n-sumption of over 500 units by December 2017, and for those with a consumption of 200Œ500 units \\nper month by December 2019. UDAY™s term ended in March 2020. A new reforms-based and results-\\nlinked distribution sector scheme has now been proposed with an outlay of over $40 billion. \\nThe Department of Science & Technology has also been a collaborating partner with the Joint \\nProgramming Platform ERA-Net Smart Energy Systems (JPP SES) and Mission Innovation (MI) in \\nthe joint call on Digital Transformation for Green Energy Transition (MICall20). With the MICall20 \\nand JPP SES, in collaboration with MI, there has been a call for global transnational projects and \\nsupport for the following objectives:\\nŁ Advancing the green energy transition in all sectors of the energy system while ensuring \\nsecurity of supply;\\nŁ Shaping new transnational business and investment opportunities by sector, with the cou\\n-pling and development of new value chains in innovative and cost-effective energy solu\\n-tions; and Ł Ensuring social sustainability and coherence with digitalization in other sectors in the \\n progression of the green energy transition.\\nClimate change and sustainable development\\nIndia is set to be at the centre of the world™s energy stage, given expectations that it will contribute \\naround 25% to the projected growth in global energy demand. Urbanization will be a key driver of \\nthis trend given that an additional 315 million people, almost the population of the US today, are \\nexpected to live in India™s cities by 2040, pushing up energy demand.\\n290\\nFigure 9.5\\nPer capita CO\\n2 emissions in selected countries and regions\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 9.5\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n204302468101214161819701975198019851990199520002005201020152020tonnesOECD AmericasOECD EuropeChinaWorldIndiaIn terms of GHG emissions, it is important to examine per capita GHG emissions from nations in \\ncomparison with the global average. This is shown in Figure 9.5.\\nClimate change will be a major challenge for India. While it is the third largest global emitter in \\nabsolute terms, with an approximate 6.4% share in global CO\\n2 emissions, the country™s per cap\\n-ita emissions are only 1.9 tonnes of CO\\n2, compared to the global average of 4.7 tonnes. This is an \\nextraordinary situation with a country high on overall emissions, but still very low on energy con\\n-sumption per person. The Indian government is cognizant of this dynamic and its policies are \\nfocused on ensuring access to sustainable and clean energy sources. This goes hand-in-hand with \\nthe UN™s SDG7. \\nThe Indian government is taking significant steps towards adopting clean energy. As part of \\nits international commitment, India put forward eight NDCs under the Paris Agreement of the \\nUNFCCC. Three of the eight NDCs set quantifiable targets to be met by 2030: Goal 3, aims to \\nreduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 33%Œ35% from 2005 levels; Goal 4, is to have 40% of \\ncumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuels; and Goal 5, aims to create an \\nadditional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO\\n2 equivalent. All efforts are aimed at improv\\n-ing energy security and energy access so as to deliver reliable and sustainable energy for its entire \\npopulation, while also keeping in mind the global good. \\n9.5 Oil demandWith the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil demand was dramatically hit. While it has recovered \\nsomewhat since the 2Q20, further lockdowns, repeated waves of infections, the advent of new \\nvirus strains and delays in vaccination programmes have kept oil demand under pressure across \\nthe world. \\nDuring 2020, Indian oil demand fell on a yearly basis for the first time in 45 years, along with its \\nglobal peers. As the impact of the initial wave of the virus eased, Indian oil demand recovered \\nquickly. Projections indicate that Indian oil demand is expected to reach its pre-pandemic level of \\n291\\nFigure 9.6\\nIndian oil demand by sector, 2019Œ2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\n4.9 mb/d in 2021. Over the WOO™s projection period, Indian oil demand is expected to grow by 3.6% \\np.a., which is consistent with its overall energy demand growth. \\nIn absolute terms, oil demand in India is set to register the highest growth between 2020 and 2045 \\namong all regions considered in this Outlook. However, compared to last year™s projections, Indian oil \\ndemand in 2045 is slightly lower at 11 mb/d, compared to 11.1 mb/d in last year™s Outlook, due to the \\ndemand drop in 2020 and the impact of two waves of COVID-19 infections. \\nAs presented in Figure 9.6, India™s oil demand growth during the projection period will be led by \\ndemand for road transport followed by the residential, commercial and agriculture sectors. Other \\nmajor contributors will be the petrochemical and aviation sectors.\\nFigure 9.6\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n2020India02468101220192021202320252027202920312033203520372039204120432045mb/dRoad transportationRail/WaterwaysMarine bunkersPetrochemicalsOther industryResid./Comm./Agr.AviationElectricity generationSource: OPEC.\\nIn terms of the product mix (Figure 9.7), diesel/gasoil and gasoline are expected to contribute \\nalmost two thirds of the oil demand growth. However, despite an increase of 2.4 mb/d in die\\n-sel/gasoil demand from 2020Œ2045, its share in total oil demand is anticipated to remain at the \\n current level of 37%, as other products expand too.\\nOil demand by sector in India\\nAs presented in Figure 9.8, Indian oil demand over the next 25 years will be led by the road trans\\n-portation sector. In the previous ten-year period, demand from road transportation was the fast\\n-est growing among all sectors. From 2020Œ2045, however, the aviation sector is projected to \\nexperience the highest growth, at more than 8% p.a. on average, but the overall share of road \\n transportation will remain the highest even in 2045.\\nIn the projection period, road transportation demand is expected to grow at 4.7% p.a., which is \\nhigher than total oil demand growth in India. In absolute terms, demand is forecast to reach \\n 5.6 mb/d in 2045, compared to 1.8 mb/d in 2020, representing the highest incremental demand \\namong all sectors. From the products perspective, demand in this sector will continued to be \\ndominated by diesel and gasoline, with gasoline demand growth rate higher than that for diesel, \\non the back of the fast expansion of India™s passenger car fleet. \\n292\\nThe share of the road transportation sector in oil demand increased from 35% in 2010 to a cur\\n-rent level of more than 40%. This is set to rise further to 50% by 2045, as the number of passen\\n-ger vehicles is expected to increase by 150 million, and commercial vehicles by more than 50 \\nmillion. Currently, India™s passenger vehicle fleet are mainly two wheeled and four-wheeled \\nvehicles running on gasoline (together with an increasing market share for two wheeled electric \\nFigure 9.8\\nSectoral oil demand in India in 2020 and 2045\\nSource: OPEC.\\nSource: OPEC.\\nFigure 9.8\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n2020India0123456RoadtransportationAviationRail/WaterwaysMarinebunkersPetrochemicalsOther industryResid./Comm./Agr.Electricity generationmb/d2020 demandIncremental demand to 2045Figure 9.7\\nShare of refined products in Indian oil demand\\nFigure 9.7\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n2020IndiaEthane/LPGNaphthaGasolineJet/KeroseneDieselFuel oilOther productsInner circle: 2010Middle circle: 2020Outer circle: 2045293\\nvehicles). Commercial vehicles are mainly diesel powered and conversion to LNG will take time \\nas the LNG infrastructure has only just started to develop. However, lighter passenger vehi\\n-cles run on CNG are gaining traction due to the enhanced availability of CNG at more than 5,000 \\nCNG stations. The target is 10,000 CNG stations by 2030. The current price differential between \\nCNG and gasoline, as well as diesel, is also a major factor in the gradual shift towards CNG \\n passenger vehicles. \\nIncreasing demand in road transportation is further driven by the Indian government™s var\\n-ious initiatives to boost road infrastructure and increase connectivity. The government has \\nlaunched ‚Bharatmala Pariyojana™, which is a new umbrella programme for the highways sec\\n-tor that focuses on optimizing efficiencies in freight and passenger movement across the coun\\n-try by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. The focus is on effective interventions, such as the \\ndevelopment of economic corridors, inter-corridors and feeder routes, national corridor effi\\n-ciency improvements, border and international connectivity roads, coastal and port connectivity \\nroads and green-field expressways. A total of around 34,800 km are being constructed with an \\n estimated outlay of $75 billion. \\nDemand from the aviation sector is forecast to be the fastest growing over the next 25 years. It is \\nexpected to grow at 8.4% p.a. on average on account of schemes such as the Regional Connectivity \\nScheme (RCS) or UDAN. The primary objective of UDAN (letting the common citizen of the country \\nfly) is to facilitate/stimulate regional air connectivity by making it more affordable. Promoting the \\naffordability of regional air connectivity is envisioned by supporting airline operators through con\\n-cessions by the central government, state governments and airport operators to reduce the cost \\nof airline operations on regional routes; and financial support to meet the viability gap (funding), if \\nany, between the cost of airline operations and expected revenues on such routes.\\nThe petrochemicals sector is set grow by 4.1% p.a. on average between 2020 and 2045, as demand \\nfor plastics and its derivatives expands in line with GDP growth. India is set to witness a transfor\\n-mation in oil to chemicals, along with the commissioning of new petrochemical plants that will \\nboost demand from the petrochemical sector. \\nIncreasing commercial activities to cater for the young and expanding working age populations, \\nalong with more intensive agricultural activities, will also improve demand for the residential, \\ncommercial and agricultural sector. Demand is expected to grow in this sector by 2.3% p.a. over \\nthe projection period. \\nOil demand by product in India\\nCurrently, Indian oil demand is dominated by diesel/gasoil and gasoline, which constitute around \\n51% of total demand (Figure 9.9). During the projection period, the share of diesel/gasoil and gaso\\n-line is expected to rise further to 57.7%, as these two products will drive the Indian oil demand story, \\nas presented in Figure 9.10. Diesel/gasoil is projected at 4.2 mb/d by 2045 compared to a level of \\n 1.7 mb/d in 2020. The corresponding figures for gasoline are 2.3 mb/d and 0.6 mb/d, respectively.\\nIncreasing activity in the aviation sector, supported by various governmental schemes, is expected \\nto boost demand for jet kerosene, which is projected to be the fastest growing refinery product. Jet \\nkerosene demand is anticipated to grow by 5.1 % p.a. during the forecast period. \\nBiofuels are expected to grow at the fastest rate among all oil products over the forecast \\nperiod. Demand is expected to expand by 5.8% p.a., supported by the push towards cleaner \\nfuels. The Indian government issued the National Policy on Biofuels 2018 wherein, under the \\nEBP programme, an indicative target of 20% blending of ethanol in petrol by 2030 was laid \\nout. Subsequently, the target year for achieving 20% ethanol blending in petrol was advanced \\nto 2025. \\n294\\nFigure 9.10\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n2020India4.510.150.590.481.640.54Œ0.032.440.070.580.0611.03024681012md/bDemand in 2020EthaneLPGNaphthaGasolineJet/keroseneKeroseneDieselFuel oilRestBiofuelsDemand in 2045Figure 9.10\\nIncremental oil demand in India between 2020 and 2045 by product\\nSource: OPEC and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India.\\n9.6 Liquids supply\\nCrude oil was first discovered in India in commercial quantities in 1889, long before many of the \\ncrude sources known today.

The goal of India™s hydrocarbon policies has been to undertake a full appraisal of all possi\\n-ble regions, including deep-sea offshore areas, with a view to tapping its full potential. India is also \\nfocusing on the redevelopment of existing mature fields, besides bringing on-stream new oil fields.\\nCrude oil supply in 2020 averaged 0.62 mb/d, with total liquids supply coming in at 0.77 mb/d. \\nWith crude oil production expected to decline in the long-term, India is pivoting to increase \\nbiofuels production to make up for the shortfall in total liquids supply. Biofuels production \\nis expected to double to 0.07 mb/d in 2026, from 0.03 mb/d in 2020, while crude production \\nremains flat to 2020 levels at 0.62 mb/d in 2026, despite small increases in the intervening \\nyears (Table 9.2). \\nIn the longer-term, crude oil production is expected to decline further to 0.39 mb/d by 2045. \\nHowever, support from increased biofuels production, rising to 0.19 mb/d in 2045, will help \\n moderate the decline in total liquids supply.\\nIndia™s proven crude oil reserves stood at 4.7 billion barrels in 2019, with a share of just 0.3% of \\nthe world™s total proven reserves, leaving the nation dependent on imports for most of its crude oil \\nneeds. To reduce its dependence on fossil fuel imports, the government is focusing on increasing \\noil and gas production from existing and potential new fields in the country.\\n296\\nIn order to increase exploration activities and to attract domestic and foreign investment in local \\nupstream production, the Indian government approved the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing \\nPolicy (HELP), replacing the erstwhile New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP). Additionally, \\nthe Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP), along with the National Data Repository (NDR), were \\nlaunched as the key drivers to accelerate E&P activities in India.\\nThe licensing programme under HELP adopted a revenue sharing model and is a step towards \\nimproving the ease of doing business in India™s E&P sector. It comes with attractive and liberal \\nterms, such as reduced royalty rates, marketing and pricing freedom, submission of expression \\nof interests the year round, a single license to cover conventional and unconventional hydrocar\\n-bon resources, exploration allowed during the entire contract period, a simplified bidding process, \\ntransparent awarding procedures and a swift approvals process.\\nTo date, four OALP bid rounds have been conducted, with a total of 94 blocks awarded with leading \\nE&P companies, covering an area of 136,790 km\\n2. The operators of these blocks have since then \\ninitiated petroleum exploration activities, or are in the process of obtaining Petroleum Exploration \\nLicenses.\\nThe successful roll-out of the HELP regime, followed by the OALP bid rounds, has led to an increase \\nin exploration acreage in India, which is expected to boost production in the medium-term. \\nFurthermore, the government has developed a National Policy on Biofuels to bring about \\n accelerated development and the promotion of the cultivation, production and use of biofuels. \\nIn recent years, the Indian government™s attention has shifted to production enhancement rather \\nthan revenue maximization, harnessing technological innovation, fostering collaboration and \\nproviding a stable and simplified policy and fiscal regime. The ground-breaking system in the \\nIndian E&P sector, combined with a single window clearance system, strong institutional frame\\n-works, attractive corporate taxes and revitalized regulatory regimes has generated phenomenal \\ninvestment opportunities in India across the entire E&P value chain, including both greenfield \\nand brownfield sites. The Indian Ministry of Petroleum™s projections sees liquids supply in 2021 \\n averaging 0.8 mb/d, rising to just over 1 mb/d by 2025. \\nOver the next five years, it is expected that investment in upstream development by production \\ncompanies will reach $5 billion p.a. from current levels of $3.8 billion p.a. The proposed capex \\ninvestment from operators has already exceeded the targets for the next two years with expecta\\n-tions for further investments. This higher investment will likely boost the number of flowing wells \\nfrom 6,500 to 8,000, a 23% increase, in the next five years (Table 9.4).\\nIn addition to increasing production, the Indian government is also employing a focused strat\\n-egy to continue to boost exploration activity in India. There are expectations for more than 200% \\ngrowth in exploration acreage, which is anticipated to increase from 157,000 km\\n2 to 500,000 km\\n2 Table 9.4\\nIndia liquids supply outlook according to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas\\nSource: Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India.\\n2020202120222023202420252020Œ2025Total\\n0.77\\n0.80\\n0.88\\n0.97\\n1.01\\n1.01\\n0.24\\nmb/d\\n297\\nFigure 9.11\\nIndian crude production parameters\\nSource: Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India.\\nBox 9.3\\nFrom Margherita to Bengal\\nThe story of oil exploration in India began in the north-eastern corner of the country. Oil \\nseepages had been reported since the early 19th century on the banks of the River Dihing, \\nduring prospecting for coal in Upper Assam, a region in Northeast India. \\nIn fact, India was on the crude map within seven years of the drilling of the world™s first oil \\nwell in 1859 at Titusville, Pennsylvania, US, when a hand-dug well of 102 feet at Nahorpung, \\nnear the Jeypore area of Upper Assam, yielded oil, even though production proved not sat\\n-isfactory. In the second attempt in 1867, oil was struck at merely 118 feet in Asia™s first \\nmechanically drilled well at Makum, near the Margherita area of Upper Assam. \\nDuring the period 1889Œ1890, the Digboi Well no.1 was drilled to a depth of 662 feet and \\ncommercial quantities of crude oil were discovered. Digboi has an interesting story con\\n-cerning its name. The engineer in charge used to urge his men to ﬁDig boy, digﬂ and hence \\nthe name ‚Digboi™ was coined. Moreover, Asia™s first oil refinery was set up at Digboi in 1901, \\nwhich is still functional and one of the world™s oldest operating refineries. \\nFigure 9.11\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n2020India3.03.54.04.55.05.56,0006,5007,0007,5008,0008,50020212022202320242025$ billionNumber of wellsDevelopment CAPEXFlowing wellsover the next five years. Along with an increase in exploration acreage, the government is also \\ninvesting in enhancing the technology used by E&P companies, including substantially expanding \\nthe areas covered by 3D seismic data.

From a \\ndeficit in 2001, the country pushed to achieve self-sufficiency in refining and is currently a major \\nexporter of petroleum products. Today, India has the world™s fourth largest refining capacity. As \\nshown in Figure 9.12, India™s refining sector has grown at a rapid pace since 2000, to keep up with \\nthe growth in oil demand.\\nIndia currently has 23 refineries spread geographically and connected via a series of cross-coun\\n-try crude and product pipelines. Traditionally, refinery utilization in India remains more than 100%. \\nSource: Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India.\\nFigure 9.12\\nCrude distillation capacity in India\\nFigure 9.12\\nmboe/dWidth:  135.6 mm\\nHeight:   65 mm\\n2020India2.02.53.03.54.04.55.05.520002002200420062008201020122014201620182020mb/dOffshore exploration was later initiated in the form of experimental seismic surveys in 1962 \\nin the Gulf of Cambay and later in other western offshore areas.

In 1982, the \\nOil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) made its biggest gas discovery in Gandhar, Cambay \\nBasin, Gujarat and by 1986, the Krishna Godavari Basin had been placed on the global map \\nwith several significant discoveries made. The most recent oil find in India was at Ashok \\nNagar in the Bengal Basin.Indian refineries have large cracking, coking and desulphurization capacities as the majority of \\nIndian crude feed is made up of medium- and heavy-sour crude whereas the majority of domestic \\ndemand is for light and middle distillates with strict sulphur limitations (Figure 9.13).\\nIndia implemented the Euro VI fuel standard for gasoil and gasoline in 2020. As already discussed \\nin Section 9.6, during the WOO™s projection period, demand from road transportation will wit\\n-ness the lion™s share of expanding oil demand. This will further enhance cracking, coking and \\n desulphurization capacities in India™s refining system. \\n299\\nSource: Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India.\\nFigure 9.13\\nIndian refining system in 2020\\nThe Indian government has taken various steps to bring more investment to the Indian down\\n-stream sector to help unlock its full potential. India started opening up its downstream retail sec\\n-tor from 2002, initially by allowing the marketing of gasoil, gasoline and jet fuel to private com\\n-panies. Private companies were free to price their products. From 2010, the Indian government \\nstarted deregulating retail pricing through the gradual removal of subsidies. Gasoline subsidies \\nwere fully removed by 2010 and gasoil subsidies were completely removed by 2014. Furthermore, \\nto ensure that Indian retail prices for gasoil and gasoline are in line with the international mar\\n-ket, daily pricing adjustments were introduced in 2017, instead of the previous fortnightly pricing.\\n Then in 2019, the government relaxed norms for setting up retail outlets in India by allowing non-\\noil companies to venture into the business by lowering the criteria for the required minimum \\ninvestment. India™s new retail outlet norms require these companies to set up a minimum of 100 \\noutlets with at least 5% of them in remote areas (those that still have a deficit in the availability \\nof retailing stations). The liberalization process has also not lost sight of the bigger picture of the \\nneed for cleaner fuel expansion so licensees are required to have at least one new alternate fuel \\nsuch as, CNG, biofuels, LPG and EV charging points, at their proposed retail outlets within three \\nyears of the commissioning of the outlet.\\nOut of 23 refineries, 14 are located along India™s coastline. The remaining nine refineries are \\nlocated inland, which has necessitated a requirement for cross country pipelines of crude and \\nproducts. India has a crude pipeline network of 10,419 km with a carrying capacity of 2.97 mb/d, \\nalong with a product pipeline network of 18,465 km, with a capacity of 2.25 mb /d. Alongside pipe\\n-lines, oil products are also distributed via rail, coastal movement and road transportation. India \\ncurrently has 77,331 retail outlets spread across the length and breadth of the country.\\nSince 2000, India™s refining capacity has grown by 4.1% p.a. \\nversus\\n growth in demand at 3.8% p.a. \\nThis has enabled India to become one of the key product exporters in the Southeast Asia region. \\nFigure 9.14 contrasts the cumulative potential refining capacity against the required refining capacity \\nin India.

It also assumes average utilization of 100% for new projects, which is based on India™s his\\n-torically high utilization rates that have often been above 100%. The cumulative required refining \\ncapacity is based on India™s medium-term oil demand and also considers demand for non-refinery \\nfuels, including biofuels and NGLs. The detailed methodology is described in Chapter 5. \\nFigure 9.14 shows that the rapid demand recovery in India outpaces refining capacity additions in \\nthe period 2022Œ2024 with a gap of up to 0.3 mb/d. However, with new capacity coming online in \\nthe latter part of the medium-term, the cumulative potential refining capacity reaches a level of \\n6.1 mb/d by 2026, which is equal to the cumulative required refining capacity in the same year. This \\nmeans that India™s capacity expansion is fully justified by the oil demand outlook. However, consid\\n-ering the ambitions of India™s downstream sector to maintain its strong position in the international \\n downstream market through product exports, higher capacity expansions would be required.\\nTable 9.5 provides a list of refinery projects assessed as possible for completion in the medium-\\nterm period (2021Œ2026), with a total estimated additional cumulative capacity of 1.7 mb/d. \\nHowever, due to uncertainties and possible delays, it is expected that only around 65% of this \\ncumulative capacity will materialize in the 2021Œ2026 timeframe. Beyond 2026, OPEC™s Reference \\nCase does not project the construction of specific refining projects, but estimates required \\n refining capacity for a specific region based on oil demand, supply and trade.\\nIn order to meet growing domestic requirements, Indian oil companies will undertake various \\ngreenfield and brownfield refinery projects. Indian refinery capacity additions are not only aimed \\nto cater for domestic demand, they are also intended to capture supply deficits in South Asian and \\nneighbouring regions.\\nCurrently, India is the second biggest net exporter of oil products in the Asia-Pacific market, \\nbehind South Korea, although it is the largest net exporter of gasoil in this region. Over the WOO™s \\nprojection period, India is expected to maintain its position as a key exporter in the Asia-Pacific \\nregion. \\n301\\nSource: Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, Government of India.\\nFigure 9.15\\nRefined products exports/imports from/to India\\nTable 9.5\\nList of existing refinery projects in India\\nSource: OPEC.\\nCompanyLocation\\nCompletion\\nDistillation \\ncapacity\\n(kb/d)HPCLMumbai, MH (Mahul)202140HPCLVisakhapatnam, AP2022134IOCLBaraundi, Bihar (Barauni)\\n202360IOCLKoyali, Gujarat\\n202386Nagarjuna Oil Corporation\\nNagarjuna2023120IOCLPanipat (Phase 1)\\n2024100Reliance Industries\\nJamnagar, Gujarat\\n2024116MRPLMangalore, KA\\n202574BPCL (NRL)Numaligarh, AS2025120.5CPCLNagapattinam -
