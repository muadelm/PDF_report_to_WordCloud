The \\nunveiling of this edition has been timed \\nto coincide with the 6\\nth\\n \\nGECF Summit of Heads of State and Government, to be \\nheld on 22 February 2022, in Doha, the State of Qatar. \\n \\nThis alignment is to a large extent welcome, and symbolic of 2021, which was \\na yea\\nr of contrasts. When the work on this edition started, the world was still \\nreeling from the adverse impacts of the COVID\\n-\\n19 pandemic. However, the \\nglobal economy was showing signs of strong recovery; vaccine deployment, \\nalbeit unequal among nations, provid\\ned hope that the end of the tunnel was in \\nsight; a colder\\n-\\nthan\\n-\\nusual winter stimulated the needed impetus for energy \\nprices \\n-\\n \\nand gas prices in particular \\n-\\n \\nto extract themselves from the deep trough \\ninto which they fell in 2020. And then, as the post\\n-\\npand\\nemic recovery \\naccelerated, commodity prices began their upward trajectory to reach \\nunprecedented levels. For natural gas, extreme price volatility was exacerbated \\nby the vagaries of weather conditions and the intermittency of wind\\n-\\n \\nand solar\\n-\\nbased power ge\\nneration. Then came COP26, a milestone in global efforts to \\nmitigate and adapt to climate change, and which was preceded by a flurry of \\nnet\\n-\\nzero pledges and greenhouse gas emissions reduction initiatives. Towards \\nthe end of the year, a new coronavirus vari\\nant, Omicron, appeared. More \\ntransmissible but less severe, it nevertheless led to another round of restrictions \\nand caused further havoc to supply chains. In the meantime, inflation reached \\nlevels not seen for decades, prompting the question of whether th\\nis is just a \\ntemporary phenomenon, or rather more structural in nature.   \\n \\nThe GGO assesses the global and regional prospects of economic growth, \\nenergy demand and supply, natural gas trade and investment, and the effect of \\npolicies, technologies and other\\n \\ndrivers. It also explores several scenarios, such \\nas an accelerated energy transition, or a rapid hydrogen deployment.\\n \\nThe key take\\n-\\naway of this new edition of the GGO is quite straightforward: \\nnatural gas will play a pivotal role in alleviating energy po\\nverty, fuelling economic \\ngrowth, improving living standards and expanding prosperity, whilst contributing \\nto the protection of the environment. In short, natural gas is the energy for \\nsustainable development. \\n \\nAccording to the United Nations, the global population is expected to increase \\nby 1.9 billion people by 2050, with the large majority of this demographic change \\ntaking place in Asia and Africa. The level of urbanisation will rise to 68%, \\nmeaning that 2.5 b\\nillion additional people will live in cities. Global GDP will more \\nthan double in real terms, with China and India contributing to over a third of \\nglobal output in 2050. \\n \\nConsequently, and despite energy efficiency improvements, global energy \\nneeds will gr\\now. All energy sources will contribute to satisfying these needs. \\nThere is no one\\n-\\nsize\\n-\\nfits\\n-\\nall model. Future energy pathways will vary from one \\ncountry to another. Understandably, \\nthe \\nenergy transition in India cannot be the \\nsame as in Europe. Natural gas\\n \\nis energy that fits most pathways. It helps to \\ntransition away from the use of wood and dung for cooking; thus alleviating the \\nadverse impacts of indoor pollution and reducing deforestation. It contributes to \\nimproving air quality, notably in densely\\n \\npopu\\nlated mega cities and urban \\nsprawls. It is a partner of renewables; providing much\\n-\\nneeded backup and \\nstability to power grids. Available, reliable, flexible and with a diversity of \\nproducers, natural gas is a true pillar of energy security. \\n \\nRecent energy \\nmarkets developments have underlined the critical role of natural \\ngas in ensuring a continuous and affordable supply to end\\n-\\nconsumers, in \\nparticular when the wind is not blowing and the sun not shining.  They have also \\nepitomised the globalisation and incr\\neased financialisation of natural gas \\nmarkets. Additionally, they have emphasised the positive role that natural gas \\nplays in many important sectors and for the daily life of people. \\nThis even \\nincludes food security\\n, as natural gas is a key input in the production of \\nfertilisers. \\n \\nFurthermore, and perhaps most importantly, these developments have \\ndemonstrated that investment in natural gas is critical for the stability of global \\nenergy systems. The GGO projects that \\nby 2050, total upstream and midstream \\ninvestments will reach a hefty \\nUSD\\n \\n8.7 trillion. A lack of investment will lead to \\nhigher gas prices, which, coupled with higher carbon prices, may result in \\n\\ns resistance to \\nenergy transition policies in developed countries. The ripple effect of these \\nundercurrents will be even more dramatic in developing countries. \\n \\nEnvironmental policies are a key driver of the projections contained in this \\nOutlook. In this c\\nontext, whilst upholding that natural gas is the cleanest of fossil \\nfuels, the GGO explores the state of technologies that will make it even cleaner. \\nCarbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) is a promising pathway, as it \\ninvolves proven technologies\\n \\nand attracts increased interest. The number of \\nnew CCUS projects launched in 2021 has sharply increased. Methane \\n \\n3\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nemissions are expected to be reduced, especially considering that in most \\ncases, this is a commercially\\n-\\nsound undertaking. Blue hydrogen deriv\\ned from \\nnatural gas is the least costly option to decarbonise high\\n-\\ntemperature process \\nindustries, such as steel and cement industries. Direct air capture, though still \\nvery expensive, is also attracting more attention and research funds.  \\n \\nIn closing, I w\\nould like to express appreciation to my predecessor, HE Dr Yur\\ny\\n \\nP. Sentyurin. It is under his tenure that most of this edition has been prepared. \\nI would also like to thank the team of the GECF behind this report. It has worked \\nwith dedication despite the \\ndifficult circumstances imposed by the coronavirus \\npandemic. Acknowledgment is made to OPEC for enriching the Outlook with its \\ncontribution, featured in Chapter 3. My deepest thanks go also to IHS Markit, \\nwhich provided data services for the Global Gas Mod\\nel, and to the Oxford \\nInstitute for Energy Studies for peer reviewing this latest edition of the Global \\nGas Outlook 2050. \\n \\n \\nEng.

The document also represents an impartial view on gas market \\nevolution by highlighting the most likely developments in the medium and \\nlong\\n \\nterm\\n.\\n \\nThe GECF Reference Case Scenario (RCS) highlights the current situation\\n \\nand the \\nevolution of the gas market and energy trends to 2050, in terms of global energy \\ndemand (by region/sector/fuel) and global gas supply (conventional and \\nunconventional), for GECF and non\\n-\\nGECF countries. It also reflects current energy \\npolicies and \\nthe potential introduction of new policies that are likely to materialise \\nthroughout the forecast period, according to our assessment. \\n \\nAdditionally, this document explores the subject of competition from alternative sources \\nof energy as well as technologi\\ncal developments and their eventual impact on the \\nenergy mix and gas market shares, with a focus on power generation as a strategic \\nsector for gas demand growth. Energy efficiency, environmental policies and other \\nregulations have been considered in the RC\\nS, to study their impact on gas penetration \\nin key markets/sectors.\\n \\nThe GECF Secretariat believes that it is impossible to cover all future uncertainties with \\na single scenario; multiple scenarios are needed to have a broader mapping of the \\nuncertainties s\\nhaping the development of gas markets. In this regard, the Secretariat is \\naddressing future uncertainties and their possible impact with alternative scenarios \\nthrough the annual publication of the GECF Global Gas Outlook.\\n \\nThis document is divided into six \\nmain chapters. Chapters I and II introduce key global \\ngas demand assumptions, including economic, energy price and policy assumptions, \\nas well as environmental policy development. Chapter III highlights energy and gas \\ndemand trends, followed by supply assu\\nmptions in Chapter IV, which include global gas \\nresources and upstream production. Chapter V is dedicated to natural gas trade and \\ninvestment outcomes resulting from the equilibrium between supply and demand, as \\nwell as pipeline, LNG liquefaction and regas\\nification capacity assumptions, natural gas \\ncontracts, and the corresponding investment figures. It takes into consideration gas \\nmarket constraints in terms of supply infrastructure, international supply contracts and \\ngas supply policies (e.g., the satisfa\\nction of domestic gas demand as a priority for some \\ncountries).\\n \\nThe final chapter casts a critical eye over significant developments in the energy \\ntransition, analysing them from an oil and gas perspective and weighing up the \\nopportunities they could prese\\nnt in the Energy Transition Scenario (ETS) and Hydrogen \\n\\ntransformation of the global energy sector, induced by a pressuring climate change \\nmitigation agenda and a call to dec\\narbonise the global economy by mid\\n-\\ncentury.

The fastest growth will be seen in Africa, where the population \\nis expected to almost double by 2050 to 2.5 billion.\\n \\n \\nAlmost 70% of the total population in 2050 will \\nlive in urban environments, pointing to greater use of \\nelectricity in final demand as well as demand for fuel inputs to power stations. This could have a \\nbeneficial impact on gas demand as a complement to increased renewable electricity.\\n \\n \\nGlobal long\\n-\\nterm e\\nconomic growth is based on two core factors: rising productivity \\n-\\n \\nGDP per capita \\n-\\n \\nas well as accelerated demographics, namely population increase combined with surging \\nurbanisation.\\n \\n \\nGlobal GDP growth will average 2.7% p.a. in real terms to 2050, with gro\\nwth returning to pre\\n-\\npandemic levels once the short\\n-\\nterm effects of COVID 19 have dissipated during 2021\\n-\\n2022.  Long\\n-\\nterm growth will largely come from the expanding developing economies, especially in Asia. \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nregion will be the economic growth \\n\\nover 2020 \\n\\n \\n2050, with developing South and South\\n-\\nEast Asia leading the way.\\n \\n \\nOverall, GECF countries are expected to grow at an average of 2.5% p.a. to 2050.\\n \\n \\nChina will lead economic growth in Asia as \\nthe developed economies in the region expand, albeit \\nfollowing a slower trajectory. India will also show rapid economic growth, thanks to the impacts of \\nurbanisation and improvements in infrastructure and human capital. Overall, GDP growth in \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nregion is expected to be 3.6% p.a. in the 2020\\n-\\n2050 period, although China will grow at 4.5% \\np.a. and India at 5.2%.\\n \\n \\nIndia and China combined currently account for 36% of the global population and 21% of global \\nGDP. In 2050, the respective totals will be 3\\n1% and an impressive 33%.\\n \\n \\nThe global gas model assumes a real oil price of USD60/bbl (Brent) based on long\\n-\\nrun marginal \\ncosts of supply and the belief that efficiency improvements will dampen demand in the transport \\nsector over time.\\n \\n \\nGas prices will remain\\n \\nhigh until supply and demand are rebalanced but will then move back towards \\nhistorical norms of around USD9/mmbtu in Asia, USD7\\n-\\n8/mmbtu in Europe and USD4/mmbtu in the \\nUS.\\n \\n \\nCoal prices are expected to fall back from current high levels and remain depressed\\n \\nthroughout the \\nperiod to 2050 as demand declines. The only saviour could be the broad development of CCUS, but \\nthis is not assumed in this Outlook. As a result, it is expected that the global coal price will fall back \\nbelow USD 80/t for the period to 2050\\n.\\n \\n \\nCarbon pricing and taxation is expected to become a major force behind the energy transition, with \\nmany countries expected to set up carbon markets.

Key assumptions include quantitative assumptions such as population \\nand urbanisation trends, economic prospects, projections for natural gas, oil and coal \\nas well as carbon prices. Qualitative assumptions include the impl\\nications of the COVID\\n-\\n19 pandemic, general social and economic policies, primarily those in response to the \\npandemic, as well as technological development and the geopolitical situation. Energy \\nand environmental policy assumptions are covered in Chapter 2.\\n \\nDemographic assumptions underlying the Outlook are based on the United Nations \\n(UN) forecasts for population and urbanisation. The short\\n-\\nterm and mid\\n-\\nterm \\nmacroeconomic assumptions are based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \\nprojections and the \\nGECF Secretariat estimates. The long\\n-\\nterm macroeconomic \\nassumptions and reference energy price projections have been developed in\\n-\\nhouse by \\nthe GECF Secretariat. Neither the qualitative nor the quantitative assumptions \\nnecessarily reflect the views of indiv\\nidual GECF Member Countries.\\n \\nLong\\n-\\nterm economic projections are outlined for several aspects of the global economy \\nand selected markets, as \\nwell\\n \\nas for the largest global economies, both national and \\nregional. These non\\n-\\ntechnical assumptions are based on t\\nhe underlying long\\n-\\nterm \\neconomic and social scenarios for the GGO Reference case developed in\\n-\\nhouse by the \\nGECF and quantified in the GECF GGM assumptions for the respective indicators. \\n \\nThe longer\\n-\\nterm trends over the Outlook period have been revised upwa\\nrds.\\n \\nI\\nn\\n \\n2021 after a downward revision in 2020 as a consequence of COVID\\n-\\n19, which poses \\na more \\npromising view for global sustainable economic development compared to the \\n \\n18\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nlast edition of the GGO in 2020.

The pace of the COVID\\n-\\n19\\n-\\ninduced econo\\nmic recovery and change in global economic behavioural patterns will \\nremain the major factors posing limitations and risks for the underlying forecasting \\nexercise. At the same time, the continued escalation of the geopolitical situation, \\nprimarily the US\\n-\\nC\\nhina multilateral standoff\\n, and the slowing of global trade, with the \\nresultant challenges for globalisation, add up to uncertainty regarding the medium\\n-\\n \\nand \\nlonger\\n-\\nterm perspectives.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nLONG\\n-\\nTERM OUTLOOK 2020 \\n\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n0.8% p.a.\\n \\npopulation\\n \\ngrowth\\n \\n \\n2.7% \\np.a.\\n \\nGDP\\n \\ngrowth\\n \\n \\nUS\\nD \\n60 per bbl\\n \\nBrent oil\\n \\n \\nprice\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1.1\\n \\nPopulation and demographics\\n \\nPopulation growth will be the main driver of future energy trends.

This infers a slowing of global population growth over the coming \\ndecades.

The m\\nain reason behind the decrease in global population \\ngrowth rates is the decline in fertility rates in developing regions as they progress \\ntowards the completion of their fertility transition.

There is an improved view on recovery, but there are clear \\ndifferences between developing and advanced economies with advanced economies \\nclearly picking up the pace much quicker than \\nthe developing world. The key factors of \\nglobal recovery remain the same \\n\\n \\nprogress strongly depends on the pace of \\nvaccination rollout across the globe and relevant and timely policy supports being put in \\nplace.\\n \\nHigher than anticipated commodity prices ha\\nve helped sustain growth, especially in the \\ndeveloping world, but the COVID\\n-\\n19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact, leading to a \\n3.1% decline in the global economy in 2020.\\n \\nShort\\n-\\nterm GDP growth projections are 5.9% for 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, according to \\nt\\nhe most recent IMF World Economic Outlook, October 2021. In the longer term, global \\nGDP will be 5.6% or USD 10 trillion lower in 2050 according to the GECF 2021 forecast \\ncompared to pre\\n-\\nCOVID projections. \\n \\nThe outlook remains uncertain, even though the pan\\ndemic may now be coming under \\ncontrol. Its impact across the global economic value chain is still noteworthy, however. \\nIt might cause more significant impediments for emerging markets which could become \\nless competitive as advanced economies benefit from c\\nolossal government stimulus \\npackages and better access to vaccination in addition to superior medical services. \\n \\n1.2.1\\n \\nShort\\n-\\nterm economic outlook\\n \\nShort\\n-\\nterm economic growth and COVID\\n-\\n19: stronger than expected economic recovery \\nis anticipated but there is a hig\\nh divergence \\'price\\' between advanced and developing \\ncountries. \\n \\nThough the global GDP level is still below the pre\\n-\\npandemic trajectory, the absolute \\nvalue of global GDP has surpassed the pre\\n-\\npandemic level, with advanced economies \\n\\nhe developin\\ng countries trying to catch up.\\n \\n \\n25\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFor over one and a half years the COV\\nID\\n-\\n19 pandemic adversely affected\\n \\nall world \\neconomies. As of \\n1\\nst\\n \\nFebruary 2022\\n, there had been \\n5.7\\n \\nmillion deaths and \\nover 377\\n \\nmillion COVID\\n-\\n19 cases \\n[2]\\n,\\n \\nalongside a long\\n-\\nlas\\nting adverse health, social, economic \\nand humanitarian impact on people, livelihoods and communities resulting in \\nexacerbated global poverty and growing inequality. \\n \\nBut there is definitely a light at the end of the tunnel as national economies are \\nimprovi\\nng, coming back on track towards a strong rebound. Accelerated vaccination \\nrollouts are taking place but at very different speeds across the globe, consequently \\nadding to the diversions of the recovery\\n. \\nA total of \\n9\\n.\\n9\\n \\nbillion vaccine doses have been \\nadministered \\nas of 30\\nth\\n \\nJanuary 2022\\n \\n[2]\\n. Also, there is an evident advancement in the \\nprovision of relevant monetary and fiscal policies and measures to help support the \\nrecovery. Substantial fiscal support from government\\ns and sizable monetary stimulus \\nmeasures from the central banks were provided to smooth the impact of COVID\\n-\\n19, and \\nthis has led to a more rapid than anticipated post\\n-\\nCOVID recovery getting underway, \\nalthough it is very uneven and diverging among advanced \\nand developing economies, \\nand across various countries and sectors. One of the main challenges is the difficulties \\nin kickstarting the recovery for the most vulnerable nations, as it is difficult for them to \\nconfront their economic challenges and to fight \\nagainst COVID as they are lagging \\nbehind on vaccination levels and GDP growth rate recovery.\\n \\nDisruptive supply chains and rising inflation are the two greatest challenges to be \\nhighlighted in the short run. The resurgence of the Delta variant for some coun\\ntries is \\nrestricting activities again and leading to additional supply shortages and bottlenecks. \\nAs countries globally recover after the pandemic \\n\\n-\\n\\n \\nthey are facing the \\nchallenges, which may have been exacerbated, of their pre\\n-\\nCOVID strengths and\\n \\nweaknesses. \\n \\nInflation is definitely in the spotlight. Inflationary pressures on the economy are fuelled \\nby higher commodity prices such as oil, natural gas, metals, food, etc.\\n \\nTherefore\\n, there \\nis \\nexplicit \\nevidence that the \\nimpediment\\n \\nof uneven progress i\\nn vaccination rates has led \\nto substantial and ongoing tension on global supply chain disruption, which, in its turn, \\nis leading to inflation and unemployment pressures. There are increasing orders and \\nrising demand on one side versus a spike in input pric\\nes of core commodities on the \\nother. In particular, shipping costs have surged, tripling during 2021. It is also worth \\nnoting that inflation is naturally more volatile in emerging, as opposed to advanced, \\neconomies.\\n \\n \\nShort\\n-\\nterm GDP growth projections are 5\\n.9% for 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, according to \\nthe most recent IMF World E\\nconomic Outlook, October \\n2021\\n \\n[1].\\n \\nGlobal growth after \\n2022 is projected to gravitate to about 3.5% in the medium\\n-\\nterm up to 2026 \\n[\\n5\\n]\\n.\\n \\nThe US and China are key driving forces behind the\\n \\npost\\n-\\nCOVID recovery, with the US \\neconomy showing outstanding resilience.

The \\nunprecedented scale and magnitude of monetary and fiscal support played a significant \\nrole. The largest financial stimulus rescue package ever of USD2 trillion \\n-\\n \\nofficially called \\nthe\\n \\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CA\\nRES) Act \\n-\\n \\nwas adopted by the \\ncountry in March 2020. \\n[\\n4\\n]\\n \\nA strong rebound of the financial markets promptly followed: \\na 34% fall in US equity markets in March 2020 was swiftly followed by growth to 34% \\nabove their pre\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 highs by the end of August 20\\n21 \\n[3]\\n.\\n \\nChina has recovered from the pandemic much more quickly than any other country.  It \\nenjoyed positive economic growth of 2.3% during 2020 and is heading for growth of 8% \\nin 2021 and a more modest 5.6% in 2022. The relative downward pressure on China\\n\\nprospects for 2021 is attributed to a stronger than anticipated scaling back of public \\ninvestment. Longer\\n-\\nterm, geopolitical risks remain elevated as \\nthe \\nescalation of trade \\nand technology tensions between the US and China might have a negative impact o\\nn \\ninvestment and productivity growth, \\nadding some extra\\n \\nimpediments on the road to post\\n-\\nCOVID recovery \\n[1]\\n.\\n \\nGlobally, the COVID\\n-\\n19 induced recession in 2020 was significantly less severe than \\n\\nP according to the \\nrecent IMF World Economic Outlook contracted by only 3.1% last year versus the \\nGECF\\'s previous forecast of \\n-\\n \\n4.4%. As an economic area, Europe exhibited the worst \\ncontraction, while as far as individual countries were concerned, India an\\nd Mexico \\ntopped the table with negative growth rates of \\n-\\n7.3% and \\n-\\n8.3%, respectively. However, \\nglobally these falls were balanced out by the 2.3% GDP growth witnessed in China. \\n \\nThe 2021 global GDP forecast has been revised upwards to 5.9% from the previo\\nus \\n5.2%. This is due to the strong anticipated economic recovery and robust growth of the \\ntwo main global growth engines, the US and China, which are forecast to grow at 6.0% \\nand 8.0% respectively in 2021, with 5.2% and 5.6% expected in 2022.\\n \\nGlobal trade \\nwill remain one of the most important drivers of global sustainable growth \\nin the years to come and will continue to be impacted in the short\\n-\\n \\nto medium\\n-\\nterm by \\nthe US\\n-\\nChina trade tensions which have emerged since 2018. The arrival of Joe Biden \\nas US Presi\\ndent has amplified the existing situation by strengthening anti\\n-\\nChina \\nalliances and implementing additional sanctions. \\n \\nGECF member and observer countries received a double hit from the direct impact of \\nthe pandemic and lower commodity prices in 1H2020.

In this context, ASEAN countries, which made impressive econom\\nic achievements \\nbefore the COVID\\n-\\n19 outbreak, are \\nen route to \\nestablishing \\na foundation for \\nsolid reforms and strategic \\ngoals for their development over the next three decades. Moreover, ASEAN will remain even stronger if it \\ncontinues to position itself as\\n \\nan integrated market.\\n \\nThe ASEAN countries \\n\\n \\na home for over 660 million people \\n-\\n \\ncurrently possess a relatively large economy, \\ncomparable to India \\nwith a\\n \\nGDP of\\n \\nUSD\\n3 trillion. By 2050 regional GDP is forecasted to grow by \\na factor of \\n3.4 to \\nreach USD\\n10.3 \\ntrillion.  \\n \\nThe region, \\nwhich is noted for the \\nvast diversity of each of its member countries, is a leader\\n \\npar excellence\\n \\nin global integration. ASEAN is one of the top global destinations for foreign direct investment (FDI), and its \\ntrade\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nGDP ratio exc\\needs 100%.\\n \\nFactoring\\n \\nin\\n \\nthe long\\n-\\nterm economic and population dynamics, primary energy demand in the ASEAN region \\nis projected to expand by almost 75%. The promotion of cleaner fuels than coal in view of environmental \\nand air quality concerns will translat\\ne into higher gas usage and \\nthe \\nscaling\\n-\\nup of renewables. \\n \\n \\n \\n\\neconomy\\n \\nwhich is\\n \\n\\nthird\\n \\nlargest globally in terms of PPP, is se\\neing\\n \\na strong \\nrebound with the highest expected GDP growth rate of 9.\\n0\\n% in 2021 according to the IMF\\n\\n \\nJanuary\\n \\n2022\\n \\nWorld Economic Outlook update\\n, the growth\\n \\nbacked by accelerated public investment and incentives to \\nboost manufacturing. \\n \\nIndia is becoming increasingly important for the global economy. Beyond its size and improved \\nmacroeconomic situation, India is also an economy with huge potential.\\n \\nLong\\n-\\nterm,\\n \\npopulation growth will be the main driver of future energy trends. Natural gas will play a \\nsignificant role in providing energy access to regions with the most incremental\\n \\npopulation\\n \\ngrowth\\n,\\n \\nwith India \\nclearly being \\namongst\\n \\nthem, \\nwith\\n \\ndevelopment of its\\n \\ne\\nnergy infrastructure\\n \\nbeing a key requirement\\n. India \\nwill become the world\\'s most populous country in the near term, surpassing China\\'s population in late 2027, \\nalone adding around 260 million people over the forecast period of 2021 \\n-\\n \\n2050. Expanding urbani\\nsation in \\nIndia will back almost all the additional population\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n29\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 will undeniably have medium\\n-\\nterm repercussions on economic growth, \\nprimarily targeting supply potential as well as modes of consumption. Bankruptcies and \\nlimitations to efficient\\n \\nresource reallocation including disruptions in the value chains may \\npose sizable structural changes, implying the redistribution of resources over and above \\nthose sectors where distancing constraints, required workplace changes, and evolution \\nof the new r\\nemote working patterns have been introduced. New modes of production, \\nas well as consumption, will emerge and change the future of outp\\nut production across \\nthe globe.\\n \\nAdvanced economies will show a strong rebound in the mid\\n-\\nterm: GDP growth rates will \\nreac\\nh 5.2% in 2021, 4.5% in 2022, before reducing to a longer\\n-\\nterm average of 1.6% in \\n2026. In addition to the continuous effect of COVID\\n-\\n19 on economic activity, the single \\neffect of slower population growth and an aging population will contribute to the \\nslow\\ndown over the highlighted period. \\n \\nDeveloping economies, on the contrary, will see a more gradual recovery in economic \\nactivity in the medium term with 6.4% in 2021, 5.1% in 2022 and 4.4% in 2026, according \\nto the recent IMF World Economic Outlook, which r\\nemains below the average of 5.6% \\nseen between 2000 \\n\\n \\n2020. To a greater extent, this is explained by the structural \\nchange and consequent slowdown in the Chinese economy which had already started \\nbefore the pandemic hit, despite strong recovery in commodit\\ny prices, including energy \\nprices and revived external demand by the advanced economies.\\n \\n\\ntrans\\n-\\nAtlantic cooperation, which could translate into more favourable trade \\nterms \\nbetween the US and the European Union. On the contrary, global trade flows will \\ncontinue to be impacted in the medium\\n-\\nterm by \\nthe \\nUS\\n-\\nChina trade tensions, mentioned \\nearlier. Trade tensions are closely interwoven with global geopolitical tensions which \\nare high due to a confluence of factors, including US restrictions on Iran, Venezuela and \\nRussia, terrorism, cyberthreats and the dysf\\nunctional relationship between the world\\'s \\nmain superpowers. \\n \\nAs an outcome of the unprecedented government support measures to curb the worst \\nimpacts of COVID\\n-\\n19, the medium\\n-\\nterm scenario will carry the burden of considerable \\ngrowth in the already high st\\nock of sovereign, as well as corporate, debt. At the same \\ntime, lower anticipated interest rates will maintain governments\\' abilities to service their \\ndebt obligations. Global debt is now at an all\\n-\\ntime high of almost USD300 trillion, more \\nthan USD36 trill\\nion above pre\\n-\\npandemic levels. However, the global debt\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nGDP ratio \\nhas declined for the first time since the outbreak of COVID\\n-\\n19, accounting for slightly \\nover 350% at the end of 1H 2021\\n \\n[9]\\n. Lower interest rates will ease the debt servicing, \\nprimarily i\\nn advanced economies, while emerging markets and developing economies \\nwill have to pay higher interest rates due to greater inflation and overall higher sovereign \\nand corporate risk premiums.\\n \\n \\n30\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nTaking a longer\\n-\\nterm view on global economic prospects, incremen\\ntal population \\ngrowth, mainly driven by Africa and developing Asia, coupled with strong urbanisation \\nand labour productivity trends will continue to remain the key engines behind \\nsustainable economic development as well as behind primary energy demand. COV\\nID\\n-\\n\\nopportunities for more innovative, cost\\n-\\nefficient businesses, accelerating the adoption \\nof digital technology, creating and expanding new industries and altering the m\\nakeup of \\nthe workforce. Companies are choosing to increase supply chain resilience because of \\nhistorical supply chain disruptions which have been highlighted by COVID\\n-\\n19.\\n \\nBoth technological and demographic trends follow a much longer cycle. As far as \\ngener\\nal technological advancement is concerned, we do not expect any new game\\n-\\nchanging innovations in energy\\n-\\nrelated fields by 2050. The major driving forces behind \\ninnovation will still be the digitalization of the economy, the evolution towards more \\nflexible \\nmarkets and developing economies\\' transition to knowledge\\n-\\nbased economic \\ngrowth.\\n \\nWorld economic growth rates in the medium\\n-\\n \\nand longer\\n-\\nterm will remain resilient and \\nlook more positive compared to the 2020 forecast, with an average of 2.8% p.a. for 2020 \\n\\n \\n2030, an insignificant decrease compared to the growth rate of 3% p.a. during 2000 \\n\\n \\n2019. From 2030\\n-\\n2040s level of average growth rates of 2.8%, GDP will slightly \\ndecelerate to 2.6% in 2040\\n-\\n2050. Growth of the global economy, anchored by strong \\nlabour pro\\nductivity growth, is expected to average 2.7% p.a. in real GDP between 2020 \\n-\\n \\n2050. This growth rate will largely be provided by the expanding developing \\neconomies, especially in Asia, with a growing role taken by a burgeoning middle class, \\nwith China grow\\ning by 4.1% p.a. on average and India at an average of 5.2% p.a. over \\nthe Outlook horizon (2020 \\n\\n \\n2050). \\n \\nWith developed (OECD) economies on a steady growth path of 1.8% p.a., and \\ndeveloping economies (non\\n-\\nOECD) poised to grow by 3.8% p.a. between 2020 \\n-\\n \\n2\\n050, \\nlong\\n-\\nterm global economic growth is expected to be stable and is already getting back \\non track after the short\\n-\\nterm turbulence induced by COVID\\n-\\n19. \\n \\nGlobally, the projected decrease in labour input is considered to be detrimental to \\ngrowth. To some ex\\ntent, this will be remedied by extensive use of the labour force well \\nabove the present pension age in most European labour markets. In developing \\neconomies, the labour force will be significantly extended (by up to 50%) by the fast\\n-\\ngrowing inclusion of wo\\nmen and minorities. However, even these labour market \\nchanges pose a tremendous challenge for labour productivity to maintain growth. Of the \\nexpected GDP growth of 2.7% between 2020\\n-\\n2050, over three quarters comes from the \\ndeveloping economies. Additionall\\ny, out of the 3.8% p.a. of expected growth in these \\ndeveloping economies (2020 \\n\\n \\n2050), over three\\n-\\nquarters of this is expected to be from \\nproductivity improvements as the employment contribution decelerates.\\n \\n \\n31\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nWe expect the pandemic primarily to have short\\n-\\n \\nand mid\\n-\\nterm implications on global \\neconomic activity, although it will cast a shadow over a much longer period and will \\ncause fundamental structural changes to the way businesses operate, people interact, \\nand nations as a whole develop. It is widely beli\\neved that COVID\\n-\\n19 will transform the \\nworld by accelerating pre\\n-\\nexisting trends of digitalization and the speeding up of the \\nenergy transition process, contributing to more resilient and robust supply chains across \\nthe globe.\\n \\nUS President Biden contributed\\n \\nto a re\\n-\\nsetting of US foreign policy in a number of areas \\nwhich will clearly have a longer\\n-\\nterm impact on the global geopolitical architecture, \\nincluding a move towards closer trans\\n-\\nAtlantic cooperation which will translate into more \\nfavourable trade term\\ns between the US and the European Union. These include the \\ninitiation of US dialogue with Tehran on re\\n-\\njoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \\nAction (JCPOA), a nuclear deal which relies on Iran resuming compliance with all \\nrestrictions on its nuclear prog\\nram, and the recommitment by the US to the Paris \\nAgreement which potentially implies cutting US emissions to net\\n-\\nzero by 2050 and \\nlaunching a USD2 t\\nrillion green stimulus package.\\n \\nRegional prospects for economic growth\\n \\nIncremental population growth, mainly\\n \\ndriven by Africa and developing Asia, coupled \\nwith strong urbanisation and labour productivity trends, will continue to remain the key \\nengines behind sustainable economic development as well as behind changes in \\nprimary energy demand (as shown in Figure 1\\n.7.). The majority \\n-\\n \\nover three\\n-\\nquarters \\n-\\n \\nof global real economic growth will be attributed to labour productivity over the long run \\ntill 2050, while the rest will be accounted for by world population growth.\\n \\nThe centre of economic gravity will shift towa\\nrds Asia Pacific, more specifically to \\ndeveloping Asia. Developing economies are already almost 50% larger than developed \\neconomies in terms of their GDP and will be around 2.5 times larger by 2050.

Though historically crude oil and natural gas are inherently \\nvolatile commoditie\\ns, 2020 and 2021 were extremely erratic years for \\nthe \\nprices of these \\nproducts. \\n \\nThe pandemic triggered a \\ndownward pressure\\n \\non the oil price, which was already \\ndeclining due to geopolitical tensions and a slowdown in the global economy in general. \\nThe pric\\ne of Brent crude oil, a global benchmark, fell from USD66/bbl on the first trading \\nday of 2020 to USD16/bbl on April 22 (intraday quote), a decline of 76% in less than \\nfour months, as COVID\\n-\\n19 induced a collapse in global oil demand and concerns grew \\nover \\nhigh levels of storage capacity. \\n \\nOil markets in the future will remain largely subject to COVID\\n-\\n19 uncertainty and the \\npace of economic recovery together with the rebound in energy demand. Additionally, \\nthe precipitous decline in oil and gas investments, the challenges of an accelerated \\ne\\nnergy transition to combat climate change, geopolitical events in the Middle East \\nbecoming more numerous as well as stronger oil production in several non\\n-\\nOPEC+ \\ncountries, the normalization of Libya\\'s and Iran\\'s oil production, plus a breakdown in the \\nOPEC\\n+ agreement should all be factored into any future price forecasting exercise. \\n \\nLiquid fuels demand is, to some extent, recovering as road traffic volumes are being \\nrestored in some countries, but it is still significantly restricted in the aviation sector\\n \\nas \\ninternational flights remain strictly limited. \\n \\nMedium\\n-\\nterm and long\\n-\\nterm drivers and Outlook\\n \\nIn the medium\\n-\\nterm, we anticipate the crude oil market will stabilize, and assume \\nbeyond 2026 it will follow the long\\n-\\nterm trend price of USD60/bbl, reflectin\\ng the COVID\\n-\\n19 effect and also taking into account efficiency savings.

The major \\nregulation changes could take place around 2030 if rapidly developing electric \\npow\\nertrain technology is ready for global mass production by then.

On \\ntop of the post\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 recovery, a general rebound i\\nn prices was explained by \\nmarket fundamentals as well as temporary dynamics, primarily driven by the supply \\nside: a colder than expected winter, LNG supply disruptions and limited shipping \\ncapacity as well as supply constraints related to the planned and u\\nnplanned \\nmaintenance of pipeline infrastructure and LNG liquefaction facilities.\\n \\n \\nDespite being at initially low levels on average throughout 2019, the natural gas spot \\nmarket witnessed plummeting prices during the first half of 2020, as a result of a \\ndown\\nturn in demand due to the economic, social and humanitarian impacts of COVID\\n-\\n19, as well as a warmer than expected 2019\\n-\\n2020 winter in the northern hemisphere.\\n \\n \\nNatural gas prices increased due to an anticipated rise in winter demand, supply \\nuncertainties \\nin Asia and various technical trading patterns.

At the same time, once the level of natural gas prices \\nstart\\ned\\n \\nrising significantly, a significant divergence in prices between the US, European \\nand Asian natural gas markets was observed due to specific price shock events and \\nhigher premiums offered by consumers, for example\\n,\\n \\nAsian consumers who were \\noffering lump\\n-\\ns\\num premiums to secure LNG cargoes. December DES JKTC cargoes, \\nfor example, were traded at USD3/mmbtu premium to European gas prices. JKM was \\npriced also at USD3/mmbtu premium to TTF, up from the earlier premiums of USD1.7 \\n\\n \\n2.4/\\n/mmbtu\\n.\\n \\nMedium\\n-\\nterm and long\\n-\\nterm drivers and Outlook\\n \\nAccording to 2021 estimates, the Henry Hub (HH) price in real terms will reach \\nUSD3.5/mmbtu in 2030, USD3.9/mmbtu in 2040 and USD4.7/mmbtu in 2050. This is in \\nline with forecasts made in 2020, where the projection for HH stood at \\nUSD3.3/mmbtu, \\nUSD4.1/mmbtu and USD4.7/mmbtu, respectively.\\n \\nGenerally, for forecasting purposes, international benchmark gas prices tend to be \\nendogenous to the model, either linked to oil product prices or the marginal cost of \\nsupply. Oil\\n-\\nindexed prices ar\\ne estimated based on the spot or wholesale price of gasoil \\nand fuel oil in the relevant markets, while the spot gas price is determined endogenously \\nin the gas trade model and is the marginal cost of supply to the end\\n-\\nuse market. \\n \\nFigure 1.\\n12\\n. \\nNatural gas long\\n-\\nterm prices 2020 \\n-\\n \\n2050 (USD\\n/mmbtu\\n)\\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat base\\nd on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\n \\nWe project that the structure of the natural gas market over the outlook period will \\nremain largely geographically segmented.

Regional gas markets, which currently have weaker connectivity, are \\nexpected to become strongly integrated post\\n-\\n2035, as the rapid development of LNG \\ncapacity, as well as transportation and trading networks, including large\\n-\\nscale export \\npip\\neline projects, stimulate market integration. Thus, we expect that until at least 2035, \\nAmerican and European markets, as well as the Asian and Latin American markets will \\nremain integrated market regions with the most natural gas liquidity, whereas after \\nthat \\ndate it is projected that a global gas market will start emerging, with regional differences \\nbeing less significant.\\n \\nFor the Asian market, it is reasonable to expect that competition in the LNG market will \\n\\nium term. Lower prices will intensify gas \\npenetration in Asia, which is expected to be beneficial for natural gas consumption in \\nthe long run. The Chinese market is expected to remain tariff\\n-\\nprotected from US LNG \\nand the size of the existing Asian market m\\night not be sufficient to cover all Chinese \\ndemand growth by swaps.\\n \\nThe European market will remain the residual market for LNG, but if pipeline suppliers \\nchoose to protect their market share, the ample pipeline capacity will render LNG \\nsupplies uncompetit\\nive outside of long\\n-\\nterm contracts used for supply diversification. \\nGlobal flexible LNG supplies to Europe will put strong pressure on European gas prices \\nin the medium term. As Asian demand catches up, all this LNG pressure will gravitate \\ntowards the prem\\nium markets. \\n \\nThe long\\n-\\nterm trend in natural gas prices will be driven higher by the following: \\n \\n \\ndespite \\nthe \\ntechnological advancement, gas production is expected to become \\nincreasingly capital intensive, with an increasing demand facing higher LRMC.\\n \\n \\nincreasing carbon tax and methane abatement policies will put additional \\npressure on the cost of using natural gas after coal\\n-\\nswitching benefits have \\nbeen exhausted.\\n \\n \\nthe LNG glut will lead to an investment pause, thus providing grounds for a \\ndemand\\n-\\ndriven \\nincrease in natural gas prices after 2030. \\n \\nThe market structure in the long\\n-\\nterm will likely gravitate towards many instruments \\ntraditionally present in the other commodity markets, such as an increased role for \\ntrading hubs, growth in the financializatio\\nn of the natural gas trade and the greater role \\nthat settlement trades typically play. However, most commodities trade in hubs with \\nproper infrastructure, which is why futures markets such as the JKM will need \\ninfrastructure support. In the longer\\n-\\nterm, LN\\nG indices based on growing markets (such \\nas China or the recently discarded Sling index) will be more suitable to use as a \\nbenchmark, as these markets are striving to develop a gas trading infrastructure that \\ncan provide backing for settlement (or \\n\\npaper\\n\\n)\\n \\ntrades.\\n \\n \\n45\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nRegional price convergence is expected to persist towards 2050. In Latin America, \\nbooming indigenous natural gas production and the short distance for US LNG \\nshipments will keep prices basically tied to Henry Hub. For Europe, strong price \\npressure\\n \\nis expected following the introduction of a new phase of the ETS and planned \\ncoal and nuclear capacity phase\\n-\\nouts in the 2030s. The Asian market will face more \\nflexible shipments from most LNG suppliers, as well as several new pipeline links. \\nHowever, due\\n \\nto an investment pause in the mid\\n-\\n2020s, the Asian premium will still \\nhold. \\n \\n1.3.3\\n \\nThermal coal\\n \\nThe coal market is relatively strong in the short term but will be under increasing \\npressure due to competition from gas and also thanks to the increasing focus on n\\net\\n-\\nzero emissions targets in a growing number of countries. Without the commercial \\ndeployment of CCUS, which is not assumed, the prospects for demand are weak and \\nthe price is expected to remain depressed.\\n \\nCoal prices have been decreasing due to competitio\\nn with natural gas for electricity \\ngeneration, although supply problems in South Africa and strong demand from Indian \\nindustrial buyers have sustained South African coal prices. In Australia, coal prices have \\nbeen pressured by China\\'s more stringent import\\n \\nrestrictions and Japan\\'s plans to \\nphase\\n-\\nout inefficient coal\\n-\\nfired power plants by 2030. \\n \\nThe coal market is expected to remain under pressure amid growing natural gas\\n-\\npowered production and the rising share of renewable energy generation as more \\ncountrie\\ns try to move to more environmentally\\n-\\nfriendly energy. Japan and South Korea \\nhave promised to reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases to zero by 2050 and China \\nhas opted for a zero\\n-\\ncarbon future commitment by 2060. US President Joe Biden has \\nalso confirme\\nd he will reinstate the US\\'s adherence to zero\\n-\\ncarbon emissions by 2050. \\nCoal exports are expected to remain below pre\\n-\\npandemic levels in 2021.\\n \\nMedium\\n-\\nterm and long\\n-\\nterm drivers and Outlook\\n \\nAs for thermal coal prices, in contrast to the converging trend in\\n \\nlong\\n-\\nterm natural gas \\nprices, we are here witnessing a significant divergence in pricing with naturally lower\\n-\\nlevel pricing projections due to the consequences of COVID\\n-\\n19 and the slump in GDP \\ngrowth and energy demand.\\n \\nFor forecasting purposes, as previou\\nsly mentioned in the case of crude oil prices, a \\nsingle coal price is used as the main reference for our base case, namely Richards Bay, \\nSouth Africa, from which the other coal prices, i.e. Newcastle Australia, Guangzhou, \\nChina\\n,\\n \\netc, are determined by applying certain historical differentials. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n46\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nFigure 1.\\n13\\n. \\nThermal coal price (USD per tonne)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat base\\nd on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nThere is an important challenge for technological \\nadvancements in energy production, \\nincluding coal, particularly in developing commercial\\n-\\nscale CCUS technologies and \\ndeploying them on the existing coal fleet. At present, the case for the commercial \\ndeployment of this technology is absent, thus its deploy\\nment remains a long\\n-\\nterm \\nprospect. However, it is clear that along with the many other environmental and \\neconomic policies being introduced, this will put pressure on coal\\'s competitiveness \\nagainst other fuels in the energy mix.\\n \\nIn the medium\\n-\\nterm, the coa\\nl market is expected to be driven by the limitations and \\nphase\\n-\\nouts of coal\\n-\\ngenerating capacities in China, and coal phase\\n-\\nouts in the US and \\na number of European countries. The lower price of natural gas will also play an \\nimportant role in limiting \\nthe \\nde\\nma\\nnd for coal.\\n \\nThe long\\n-\\nterm Outlook for thermal coal prices is to a lesser extent shaped by the supply\\n-\\ndemand balance, as capacity is expected to adjust to the accelerating decline in global \\ndemand. We do not assume the deployment of any commercial coal C\\nCUS technology \\nbefore 2050. The more important price driver is the competitiveness of coal vis\\n-\\nà\\n-\\nvis \\nalternative fuels. This will be influenced by several factors:\\n \\n \\nthe capital requirements and marginal cost of non\\n-\\ncoal power capacity in \\ndeveloping countrie\\ns, mainly gas and renewables. So far, coal remains the \\ncheapest power sector energy source on a non\\n-\\nadjusted basis.\\n \\n \\nthe global increase in carbon prices and proactive air quality policies in \\ndeveloping countries. \\n \\n0\\n20\\n40\\n60\\n80\\n100\\n120\\n140\\n160\\n2010\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nNewcastle, Australia\\nRichards Bay, South Africa\\nBaltimore, United States\\nGuangzhou, China\\n \\n47\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n \\nstrong electricity demand growth in capita\\nl\\n-\\nstrapped developing Asia and Africa, \\nand the strategies for the energy sector which those countries will adopt. While \\nmodern coal power has higher emissions than any other modern source of \\nenergy, it is still widely seen in these countries as a valid com\\npetitor to reduce \\nemissions against traditional biomass and older technology. \\n \\nWe expect that in the long\\n-\\nterm, prices will be driven by these factors and global prices \\nfor coal will fall below USD80/t on average. \\n \\n1.3.4\\n \\nCarbon\\n \\nCarbon pricing is a key instrument\\n \\nin managing the climate agenda and accelerating the \\nenergy transition. A significant rise in EU ETS prices over the past year (they have \\nalmost doubled) will have long\\n-\\nlived upwards pressure repercussions on the EU ETS \\nmarket in the range of USD58\\n-\\n74/t CO\\n2 as well impacting other regional and country\\n-\\nlevel emissions trading marketplaces.\\n \\nThe climate change agenda is playing an increasingly important role globally and is \\npropelling the use of carbon pricing as an instrument for moving along the energy \\neffic\\niency improvement pathway. Putting a price on carbon, either in the form of carbon \\ntaxation or through the application of carbon price references from the ETS, is \\nconsidered by many countries as an important lever in the mitigatio\\nn of CO2 emissions. \\nThere \\nare 65\\n \\ncarbon pricing initiatives in place or scheduled for implementation\\n \\nglobally \\n[\\n8\\n], consisting of 31 \\nETS and 30 carbon taxes.\\n \\nAn increasing number of global carbon trading systems are expected to be set up and \\nwill function on a regular basis, and tow\\nards 2050 they will be integrated into a global \\ncarbon trading system. A balance between competitiveness and climate goals will \\nstrongly impact carbon regulation. \\n \\nWhile the carbon price is expected to become the major force behind energy transition, \\nits i\\nmpact over the Outlook horizon will depend on the speed of development and \\nintegration of national carbon frameworks which have so far only been largely finalized \\nfor the European Union. \\n \\nAccording to World Bank estimates, there are about 4\\n5\\n \\nnational and 3\\n4\\n \\nsub\\n-\\nnational \\ncarbon pricing mechanisms that have been currently implemented or which are planned \\nto be implemented shortly, which afford coverage of 12 GtCO2, equivalent to \\napproximately 22% of global GHG emissions\\n \\n[8]\\n. \\n \\nAt a supranational level, the EU \\nETS, which was introduced 16 years ago, so far remains \\nthe only initiative of regional integration within a unified framework. Adherence of the \\nEU to the EU Green Deal and its goal to reach zero\\n-\\ncarbon by 2050 has strengthened \\nits commitment to the reinfor\\nced climate agenda and more rigorous carbon pricing. A \\n \\n48\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nfew EU countries also plan to expand country\\n-\\nlevel carbon pricing initiatives to \\ncomplement the EU ETS by introducing new sectors to the scheme. \\n \\n\\nexpected to rise significantly in \\nthe next decade due to tougher climate goals. The EU\\'s ETS is the largest carbon \\nmarket in the world, covering around 45% of the bloc\\'s output of greenhouse gases and \\ncharging emitters for every tonne of CO2 they emit. A s\\nurvey by the International \\nEmissions Trading Association (IETA) found members expect carbon prices in the EU \\nETS to average EUR47 (USD57) per tonne between 2021 and 2025 and EUR59 \\n(USD71) per tonne between 2026 and 2030.\\n \\nThis is mainly due to a tougher EU \\ngoal of \\ncutting emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.\\n \\nThe Chinese national ETS started in 2021 which includes schemes in provinces and \\ncities including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangdong, Hubei, Shenzhen and \\nTianjin and which reg\\nulates energy production as well as emissions from different \\nenergy\\n-\\nintensive industries.\\n \\nIn the US, there are several state\\n-\\nlevel and local trading systems, which were set up \\nanticipating the rejoining of the Paris agreement by the new Biden administratio\\nn. \\nConsequently, the national carbon price in the US might be expected to reach levels \\nwhich significantly impact competitiveness before 2030. \\n \\nOverall, emission trading infrastructure development is showing a strong pace but is still \\nlagging behind the \\nParis Agreement objectives. Price levels and the overall \\ngeographical and industrial coverage of carbon pricing initiatives still have significant \\nroom for improvement.\\n \\nFigure 1.\\n14\\n. \\nCarbon prices (USD per tonne CO2)\\n \\n \\nSource: \\nGECF Secretariat base\\nd on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\n0\\n10\\n20\\n30\\n40\\n50\\n60\\n70\\n80\\n2010\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nUS Trading System\\nEuropean Emission Trading Scheme\\nSouth Korean Trading System\\n \\n49\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nAccording to the Word Bank, most carbon prices are low, with almost half of the covered \\nemissions priced at less than USD10/t CO2. The High\\n-\\nLevel Commission on Carbon \\nPrices estimated that carbon prices of a\\nt least USD40\\n-\\n80/t CO2 by 2020 and USD50 \\n-\\n \\n100/t CO2 by 2030 would be needed in order to decrease emissions in line with the \\nParis Agreement temperature requirements \\n[\\n10\\n]\\n,\\n \\nwhile experts argue that a carbon price \\nrange of USD70\\n-\\n100/t CO2 is required to rema\\nin in line with Paris Agreement targets.\\n \\nIn the long run, prices are expected to increase gradually under policy pressure as a \\nlarger range of emissions is tackled by the carbon emission mechanisms. It is \\nanticipated that by 2050, CO2 prices will reach USD\\n75/t CO2 in the\\n \\nEU ETS and \\nUSD35/t CO2 in the JVETS\\n \\nrespectively. The South Korean national carbon price is \\nprojected to be above USD45/t CO2. \\n \\nCarbon price assumptions affect inter\\n-\\nfuel competition, especially the process of coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching. As the \\ncarbon market is expected to support the competitiveness of \\nnatural gas, we assume it will make coal more expensive to use while keeping the coal\\n-\\ngas price ratio within the affordability range.\\n \\n \\n \\n50\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2\\n.

H\\nowever, gas progress faces competition from \\nrenewables and other sources. Coal is still supported to secure affordable energy despite \\nits environmental impact.  \\n \\n \\nIn Latin America, recent problems with hydro ha\\nve\\n \\nencouraged support for gas as a \\nreliable sou\\nrce for power generation. A number of countries are also introducing new \\nmeasures to encourage gas market development and the expansion of demand\\n.\\n \\n \\nDespite aggressive decarbonisation actions under the \\n\\nFit for 55\\n\\n \\npackage, \\nnatural gas is still seen\\n \\nas having a future in the \\nEU \\nregion, especially in its role as \\nbalancing the power system and displacing coal in many central and eastern European \\ncountries\\n.\\n \\n \\nThe new US \\nadministration has radically shifted policy back towards meeting emissions \\ngoals and l\\neading the climate debate. Policy measures to inhibit the role of gas have been \\ntaken (e.g. \\nan \\nexploration moratorium on federal lands), but the fuel will still have a \\nsignificant role to play both for domestic consumption and for LNG exports. \\n \\n \\nPolicy mome\\nntum \\nis \\nspreading around the world to support hydrogen as a key driver of \\nfuture deep decarboni\\ns\\nation.

The \\ninvolvement\\n \\nof \\ncountries in net\\n-\\nzero initiatives, such as the \\nUN\\n-\\nbacked \\nClimate \\nAmbition Alliance\\n, is \\nanother incentive for them to develop policies and undertake actions th\\nat support \\ncarbon neutrality.

Th\\ni\\ns\\n \\nbusiness\\n-\\nrelated net\\n-\\nzero \\ndynamics has accelerated since the last GGO publication, partly driven by the Global \\nClimate Action initiative and its Race \\nto Zero\\n \\ncampaign. \\n \\n \\n53\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nAll these recent developments raise the pressure \\nto\\n \\ndecarboni\\nse\\n \\nenergy systems and \\nexa\\ncerbate the challenges for the hydrocarbon industry. Although the extent and \\nspeed of decarbonisation are different for \\neach \\ncountr\\ny\\n, depending on their national \\ncircumstances, there is a real need for the industry to adapt and increase its effort to \\nmitig\\nate its carbon footprint.\\n \\nRevised \\nNDCs: despite enhanced ambitions, \\nmore\\n \\neffort is needed to close the \\ngap with a Paris Agreement\\n-\\naligned trajectory \\n \\nThe COP 26 conference is a milestone event for the global climate agenda since it \\naimed at \\nadvanc\\ning\\n \\nsome \\ncritical aspects for the operationalization and \\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement. \\nA\\n \\nkey aspect relates to the updating process \\n\\nstated\\n \\nin the Paris \\nAgreement. This mechanism requires countries to\\n \\nensure an improvement of their \\nNDCs ambition every five years. \\n \\nAhead of\\n \\nNovember 2021, the date of the COP 26 conference, countries \\nsubmitted \\ntheir \\nnew or \\nupdated NDCs to the UNFCCC.  Despite \\nthat \\nthe larger \\nproportion\\n \\nof \\nNDCs\\n \\nconsiders \\nenhanced climate \\ntargets and commitments, preliminary \\nassessments show that these targets are far from closing the gap with the 1.5\\n°C\\n \\nParis \\nAgreement trajectory. The difference between GHGs emissions resulting fr\\nom the \\nupdated NDCs and the 1.5\\n°\\nC target is estimated\\n, as of \\nNovember 2019,\\n \\nat more than \\n19\\n \\nGt\\nCO\\n2\\neq by 2030\\n \\n(\\n1\\n)\\n. It highlights the huge additional effort that needs to be \\ndeployed, in a context where countries are still suffering from the severe economic \\nand social consequences of the COVID\\n-\\n19 outbreak. \\n \\nAccess to c\\nompetitive and reliable energy sources is of paramount importance for a \\nsustained economic recovery. Therefore, \\nh\\nydrocarbon sources, including the \\ncleanest amongst them, natural gas, still \\nhave \\na role to play in the post COVID\\n-\\n19 \\nera, given their large ava\\nilability and reliability. However, we should not ignore\\n \\nthe \\nfact\\n \\nthat pressure on the gas industry is rising, especially with the \\nrecent\\n \\nrelease of \\nthe first part of the 6\\nth\\n \\nIPCC Assessment Report (AR6)\\n \\n(3)\\n. \\nThis\\n \\npointed out the \\nworsening consequences of \\nclimate change, with accelerated temperature rises and \\ngreater\\n \\noccurrence\\ns\\n \\nof extreme events. The gas industry is at \\na\\n \\ncrossroad\\ns\\n, and it \\nneeds to improve its resilience to a changing environment, including through \\ntechnolog\\nical\\n \\ninnovation\\n \\n(4)\\n. \\n \\nGas still \\nreceives policy support but is increasingly challenged in the \\ndeveloped world. Decarboni\\ns\\nation of natural gas emerges as a key requirement  \\n \\nNatural gas continues to receive policy support and incentives, specifically in \\nemerging and developing countries in \\nAsia Pacific\\n, Latin America and Africa. The \\nrecently released plans and measures \\nadopted \\nin these countries give more \\nemphasis\\n \\nto natural g\\nas as a key substitute \\nfor\\n \\ncoal and oil, and a flexible complement \\nto intermittent renewables. The record level of drought \\nin many developing countries \\n \\n54\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nand larger requirements for balancing reinforce the importance of gas\\n-\\nfired power \\nplants to comply with \\nthe \\nvariability in \\nelectricity output and \\nto \\nsecure power supply. \\n \\nSeveral gas\\n-\\nsupportive policies and measures \\nhave \\noccurred since the publication of \\nthe last GGO. Countries \\nsuch as\\n \\nChina and Brazil have progressed with their gas \\nmarket reforms, which aim\\n \\nto improve competition, support investment in gas supply \\ncapacities and enhance the functioning of gas markets. India \\nis \\npursu\\ning\\n \\nthe \\nimplementation of an aggressive gas infrastructure plan to increase gas penetration \\nand support its ambitious target, des\\npite the significant impact of COVID\\n-\\n19 on \\nits \\neconom\\ny\\n. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia and Malaysia \\nhave \\nlaunched new incentives \\nand fiscal reforms to promote upstream development. Thailand \\nhas \\ngranted more \\nfacilitations for gas infrastructure buildings in l\\nine with its vision to become an LNG \\nhub in the region. \\n \\nThe implementation of clean air policies, including strengthened emissions \\nstandards\\n,\\n \\nis\\n \\nalso a driver for \\nhigher\\n \\ngas penetration against coal in power generation \\nand industry, and against oil in the\\n \\ntransport sector. These policies \\nare in addition\\n \\nto \\nthe launch or reinforcement of carbon pricing schemes in various countries \\nsuch as\\n \\nChina, South Korea or even in European countries which might drive more coal to \\ngas substitutions\\n \\nover the mid\\n-\\n \\nto long\\n \\nterm\\n. Other measures and incentives have \\ntargeted the development of small\\n-\\nscale LNG which is seen as an appropriate \\nsolution in countries lacking gas infrastructure and \\nwhich are trying to\\n \\ndevelop local \\nindustrial and power generation hubs (e.g. Vietnam, \\nPhilippines, Indonesia, \\nBangladesh). Furthermore, natural gas in the transport sector has received a policy \\npush with the implementation of plans to develop gas fueling infrastructures. India, \\nfor instance, has made significant progress with the inaugurati\\non of more than 200 \\nCNG stations in June 2021. \\n \\nDespite\\n \\nthe implementation of the above\\n-\\nmentioned gas\\n-\\nsupportive policies, the \\nrecent period has \\nalso \\nseen increasing pressure to achieve deep decarboni\\ns\\nation \\nand \\nto \\nreduce emissions from natural gas, especia\\nlly in Europe, the US and Japan. \\nThese countries \\nhave \\nunveiled policies (e.g. Fit for 55 package in the EU; carbon\\n-\\nfree power in the US) and released plans (e.g. \\ndraft 6th Strategic Energy Plan \\nin \\nJapan) which revise downwards the contribution of natural \\ngas amid the strong \\nexpected expansion of renewables, electrification and green hydrogen. Furthermore, \\nthe EU policy proposal to limit carbon and methane content for gas imports will \\nincrease the burdens on the gas producers and trigger incentives to under\\ntake \\nactions that decarboni\\ns\\ne gas supply chains\\n \\n(4)\\n. \\n \\nG\\nas producers are \\nvery\\n \\nconscious \\nof\\n \\nthe decarboni\\ns\\nation challenges. They have \\nalready started implementing solutions and policies that promote options to reduce \\nthe GHGs footprint of gas supply chains. \\nAmong these solutions are \\ncarbon capture, \\nutilisation and storage (\\nCCUS\\n)\\n, \\nthe \\nconversion of gas to hydrogen and \\na\\nmmonia, \\n \\n55\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ndigitali\\nz\\nation and efficiency improvements, \\nthe \\nelectrification of processes and \\nthe \\ndeployment of methane abatement technologies. \\n \\nIn \\naddition to decarboni\\ns\\nation, it is worth mentioning that \\nthe\\n \\nrecent upsurge in gas \\nprices adds another layer to the pressure on future gas demand and raises the fear \\nof increased gas price volatility. Nevertheless, several consuming countries \\nare \\ndeploy\\ning\\n \\npolicies and measures that aim to manage this volatility through expanding \\ngas storage capacities, reinforcing diversification of supply sources and building \\nreliable partnerships with different gas suppliers. \\nO\\nil\\n-\\nindexed gas contracts\\n \\nhave \\nsome key advan\\ntages \\nin smoothing volatility\\n \\n(the pricing formulae often include \\nsmoothing mechanisms)\\n \\nand \\nin \\nproviding stability and security of supply in an \\nincreasingly uncertain environment\\n \\n(5)\\n.\\n \\nRenewables and energy efficiency: revised ambitions, but technical and \\ne\\nconomic headwinds might \\ncreate\\n \\na mismatch with the stated targets\\n \\nSince the publication of the last GGO edition, several countries \\nhave \\nrevised their \\nrenewables penetration and efficiency targets\\n \\nupwards\\n. The EU \\nhas \\nannounced new \\nrenewable and efficiency directives with updated targets. \\n\\n \\n14\\nth\\n \\nFive\\n-\\nY\\near \\nP\\nlan \\nunveiled an ambitious commitment for renewables and strengthened \\nits\\n \\nenergy \\nintensity target. In Southeast Asia, the ASEAN cooperation framework updated its\\n \\ncollective \\nenergy \\nintensity target and added more commitments for renewables. \\nSouth Korea and Japan \\nhave \\nalso emphasized \\na\\n \\nstrengthened role \\nfor\\n \\nrenewables \\nand efficiency. \\n \\nFor renewables, there are some key global policy trends which have been confirmed \\nduring the last year: i) the orientation to shift support schemes towards more market\\n-\\nbased schemes, mainly auctioning and renewables obligations, with less reliance on \\ndirect subsidies; ii) an increasing focus on encouraging options that enable better \\nint\\negration of renewables, such as network reinforcements\\n,\\n \\nbuilding storage \\ncapacities\\n,\\n \\nencouraging flexible power plants or \\nother \\napproaches such \\nas the \\nhybrid \\nsolar\\n-\\nwind auctions adopted in India; iii) encouraging renewables in \\nthe \\nnon\\n-\\npower \\ngeneration sect\\nor, such as heating services and mobility\\n, although \\na considerable \\nportion of renewables targeting these sectors is through \\nthe \\ngreen electrification \\nchannel (i.e\\n.\\n \\nrenewables are indirectly consumed through their conversion to green \\nelectricity); iv) promo\\nting distributed renewables including solar rooftops to improve \\nenergy access and overcome \\nthe \\nlack of transmission networks. \\n \\nDespite reinforced renewables ambition\\ns\\n \\nand support schemes, several barriers still \\nexist in various countries that might \\nprevent\\n \\nthem from meeting their stated targets, \\nparticularly \\nover\\n \\nthe next decade. Among the main observed barriers, there \\nis:\\n \\nthe \\nincreased risk \\ncarried\\n \\nby renewables project developers due to fewer direct subsidies \\nand higher exposure to market prices and compe\\ntition; the severe impact of \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19\\n \\nwhich has\\n \\ndelayed renewables projects and auctions; organizational constraints \\n \\n56\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nof the power sector and difficulties \\nin\\n \\naccess\\ning\\n \\nnetworks; the lack of transmission \\ncapacities that hinders the development of large\\n-\\nscale\\n \\nprojects and contribute\\ns\\n \\nto \\nsignificant renewables curtailments\\n \\nand\\n \\ncompetition \\nfrom\\n \\nconventional hydrocarbon \\nsources to meet development requirements. \\n \\nThe integration of intermittent renewables remains a key challenge for renewables \\nexpansion, even thou\\ngh \\na \\nsignificant effort is \\nbeing \\ndeployed to improve flexibility and \\nbalancing options in different countries. The integration challenge is set to increase \\nas\\n \\nthe \\ndevelopment of renewables\\n \\ngrows\\n. It will require huge investments and deep \\ntransformation of \\npower systems to \\nmaintain\\n \\nnetworks\\n\\n \\nstability and reliability. The \\nrecent power outages in the US and Japan \\nare\\n \\nan important indicator \\nof\\n \\nthe difficulties \\nin\\n \\nmaintain\\ning\\n \\nreliabl\\ne\\n \\npower systems with increasing electrification, extreme and \\nuncertain climate events and larger intermittency \\nas a result of\\n \\nrenewables \\nexpansion. Gas\\n-\\nfired power plants will continue to play a central role in supporting \\nflexibility and renewable integrati\\non. This has been exemplified in the recent decision \\nby\\n \\nCalifornia to support gas\\n-\\nfired capacities to ensure the required back\\n-\\nup for \\nintermittent renewables. \\n \\nFor energy efficiency, the global trend to revise policy ambition \\nupwards \\nis also \\nassociated wit\\nh the consideration of various instruments that incentivize efficiency. \\nSince the publication of the last GGO, s\\neveral countries have unveiled strengthened \\nenergy performance standards for equipment and appliances (e.g. Japan) and \\ntransport vehicles (e.g. \\nChina)\\n,\\n \\nintroduced or \\nunveiled the \\nreinforce\\nment of \\nthe\\nir\\n \\ncarbon pricing schemes (e.g. China, \\nthe UK; \\nthe EU)\\n \\nand\\n \\nconsidered actions for \\nenergy\\n-\\nintensive industries (e.g. encouraging energy management systems in South \\nKorea and \\nsome \\nSoutheast Asian countri\\nes). The stimulus packages developed for \\nthe post\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 recovery have also target\\ned\\n \\nefficiency improvements, particularly \\nin buildings. These packages are particularly \\naimed at \\naccelerat\\ning the\\n \\nrenovation \\nand scale\\n-\\nup of digitalization (e.g. deployment \\nof smart meters). The latter continues \\nto emerge as a key lever for rationalizing energy consumption. \\n \\nAlthough policy orientations and adopted measures indicate more support \\nfor\\n \\nenergy \\nefficiency, its progress faces several headwinds. These include the se\\nvere impact of \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 that has slowed economic activities and impacted investments for \\nmodernization and efficiency improvements. Companies have \\ninstead \\ndirected their \\ninvestments and actions towards recovering their core activities\\n, while s\\nome \\ngovernmen\\nts have temporarily relaxed their efficiency standards (e.g. India\\n,\\n \\nIndonesia). Moreover, the growth of energy\\n-\\nintensive industries is also another \\nconstraint to global efficiency improvements. \\n \\nThe GGO \\nfactors in \\nthat \\nthese constraints might slow efficien\\ncy improvements over \\nthe short\\n \\nterm but considers that the implementation of strengthened policies will \\ndrive a significant improvement over the \\nlong\\n \\nterm\\n, specifically in buildings and \\nindustrial sectors. \\n \\n \\n57\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nStrengthened climate and clean air policies raise the pressure on \\nthe \\ncoal, but \\nconcerns around energy affordability and reliability slow its decline \\n \\nCoal is under increasing policy pressure as\\n \\nit is\\n \\nthe most carbon\\n-\\nintensive fuel and \\nresponsible \\nfor a\\n \\nse\\nvere degradation \\nin\\n \\nair quality. This pressure on coal \\ncomes from\\n \\nvarious measures including the adoption of reinforced emissions standards and \\ncarbon prices, restrictions on financing coal projects, mandat\\ned\\n \\nswitching from coal, \\nimpos\\ned\\n \\nclosure of old coa\\nl\\n-\\nconsuming plants, \\nand even \\nthe \\nmore radical \\naccelerat\\nion of\\n \\nthe phasing out of coal, \\nparticularly \\nin power generation. \\n \\nFurthermore, countries are increasingly committ\\ned\\n \\nto mov\\ning\\n \\naway from coal. For \\n\\n\\n, an \\ninitiative led by the UK and Canada \\nto phase out coal before 2030, continues to increase its members\\nhip, with\\n \\ns\\neveral \\ngovernments \\nsuch as\\n \\nSpain and East European countries (e.g. Croatia, Albania) \\nrecently join\\ning\\n \\nthe initiative. Other countries\\n,\\n \\nincluding\\n \\nthe UK, Hungary, Portugal \\nand Romania\\n,\\n \\nhave advanced their deadlines to exit from coal ahead of their initial \\nplans. Japan and South Korea \\nhave \\ncommitted to reduce their reliance on coal, while \\ncountries in South and Southeast Asia (e.g. Vietnam, Thailand,\\n \\nBangladesh and the \\nPhilippines) have revised their coal development plans.   \\n \\nIn addition, the G7 countries \\nhave \\nreleased a joint statement, agreeing on \\nending\\n \\n\\nunabated coal\\n-\\nfired\\n \\ncapacities\\n \\n(6)\\n.  It \\nis \\nbecom\\ning increasingly difficult\\n \\nto get finance \\nfor new coal projects since \\nmany \\nbanks and financial institutions have \\ndecided to \\nwithdraw \\nsupport \\nfor \\nth\\nis type of\\n \\nproject\\n.\\n \\n \\nNevertheless, it is worth noting that several countries continue to build coal power \\nplants, although \\nmore slowly\\n \\nthan \\nin\\n \\nprevious \\nyears\\n. In Asia Pacific, coal continues \\nto be seen as an important contributor to ensure affordability and security of supply.\\n \\nCoal demand has significantly increased in the region during the last \\nfew \\nmonths, \\ndriven by high gas prices and tensions \\nover the\\n \\nelectricity supply. China \\nhas \\nallowed \\nthe \\nreopening of coal\\n-\\nfired power plants, which ha\\nd\\n \\nbeen forced to close amid \\nenvironme\\nntal restrictions. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia, in particular, has more than \\n30 GW \\nof \\nnew coal\\n-\\nfired capacities in the pipeline. The ASEAN energy ministers \\nemphasized in their last declaration the importance of coal to secure \\nan \\naffordable \\nsource of energ\\ny amid growing demand\\n \\n(7)\\n. Overall, the implementation of \\nstrengthened climate and clean air policies will drive \\nthe\\n \\nstructural decline of coal \\nover the long\\n \\nterm. However, the competitiveness of coal, especially \\ngiven\\n \\nthe high \\ngas prices experienced in 20\\n21, together with its \\nability\\n \\nto secure energy supply and \\nsupport recovery from the deep post\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 recession, might slow this structural \\ndecline over the next decade. \\n \\n \\n58\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n \\nBox 2.1 Main outcomes from the COP 26\\n \\nAfter two weeks of intense negotiations, \\nthe COP 26 climate conference closed, in Glasgow, \\non the 13th of November with the adoption of the \"Glasgow Climate Pact\" (GCP). Some of \\nthe key outcomes of the GCP and Glasgow climate debates are highlighted in the following \\npoints. They involve aspects r\\nelated to emissions mitigation, adaptation, finance and \\ntechnology transfer, implemen\\ntation rules and carbon trading:\\n \\n \\n\\nKeeping 1.5°C insight\\n: The GCP pact emphasises the need to go well below 2°C and pursue \\nefforts towards reaching 1.5°C temperature incr\\nease by the end of the century. The COP 26 \\nalso marked more acceptance of the 1.5°C as a long\\n-\\nterm trajectory. Most countries, \\nrepresenting 90% of the global GDP and 90% of the worldwide GHG emissions, have \\npledged net\\n-\\nzero targets around the mid\\n-\\ncentury. \\nThis contributes to substantially closing \\nthe gap with a 1.5°C pathway. \\n \\n\\nAccelerating efforts towards phasing down unabated coal\\n: COP 26 reiterated the need \\nto reduce the role of coal, not paired with CCS/CCUS technologies, as a carbon\\n-\\nintensive \\nfuel. Ne\\nvertheless, some participants in the negotiations, particularly India, rejected the \\nprevious request to completely phasing out coal, considering \\n\\nphasing down\\n\\n \\nas a more \\nbalanced approach because of the importance of supporting economic developments.  \\n \\n\\nP\\nhasing out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies:\\n \\nDespite agreement on subsidies removal, \\nconcerns about the appropriate definition of \"inefficient\" fossil fuel subsidies were raised.\\n \\n\\nStrengthening NDCs emissions targets:\\n \\nThe GCP called UNFCCC parties to fur\\ntherly \\nreinforce their NDCs emissions in 2022 as a way to raise their ambition before a global \\nassessment (or global stocktake) scheduled in 2023. \\n \\n\\nScaling up financial resources for developing countries:\\n \\nthe GCP noted that developed \\ncountries had not re\\nached the previously set objective to mobilise 100 US billion dollars per \\nyear by 2020 to support climate actions in developing countries.  It, therefore, urged these \\ncountries to deliver on the objective by 2025 and requested to enhance the transparency \\no\\nf the funding pledges. Nevertheless, the developed countries have resisted a call from \\ndeveloping countries to pay for loss and damage caused by climate change, notably through \\nrejecting a proposal to establish a \"Glasgow Loss and Damage Facility\\'.\\n \\n\\nMakin\\ng finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas: \\nThe \\nobjective to direct financial flows towards low GHGs emissions has been reiterated in the \\nGCP and strongly voiced in the climate debates. This might\\n \\nreinforce the constraints on \\nfina\\nncing\\n \\nhydrocarbons and gas projects. For instance: thirty countries, including the US, \\nthe UK, and Germany, committed to stopping new direct public support to unabated fossil \\nfuel sectors by 2022. \\n \\n\\nDoubling adaptation support to developing countries:\\n \\nThe GCP requested developed \\ncountries to at least double the financial resources that support developing countries\\'\\n \\nadaptation to the climate change impacts. Several parties, including the EU and the US,\\n \\npledged new financial resources for executing adapt\\nation projects\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n59\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\nIn \\naddition to allocating financial resources for mitigation and adaptation actions, the GCP and \\nCOP 26 debates insisted on the importance and urgency of p\\nrocuring assistance to \\ndeveloping countries in terms of technology transfer and building capability. It was \\nindicated that these supports are more than ever needed today, given the increasing \\nimpacts of climate change and the deterioration of economic cond\\nitions in developing \\ncountries due to the COVID\\n-\\n19 outbreak.\\n \\n \\n\\n \\nFinalising the Paris Rulebook: \\nO\\nne of the critical milestones of COP26 is the completion \\nof the Paris Agreement rulebook that sets the various mechanisms and rules for \\nimplementing the agreement. In particular, COP26 reached a deal on \\nA\\nrticle 6 that provides \\nthe framework for internation\\nal cooperation, including carbon trading. It solved critical \\ntechnical issues such as double\\n-\\ncounting carbon emissions reductions in the national \\nemissions inventories and avoiding old credits issued under other schemes (e.g. Kyoto \\nProtocol) flood\\ning\\n \\nthe g\\nlobal market. Article 6 sets the foundation for scaling up \\ninternational carbon markets, including linking national markets; it also provides a \\nframework for further pushing the global voluntary carbon offset markets.\\n \\n \\nIn addition to the points mentioned a\\nbove, COP26 has seen a significant number of \\nannounced new initiatives and \\ncoalitions\\n \\nto support the low carbon transition, including \\nnotably:\\n \\n\\nThe methane pledge to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030 below the 2020 level.

Altho\\nugh natural gas has several advantages to \\nposition itself as a low carbon fossil fuel in the energy transition, the outcomes of the COP\\n \\n26 further raise the pressure on the gas industry to scale up deep decarbonisation solutions \\nfor both gas supply and dem\\nand sides.\\n \\n \\n \\n60\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nPolicy momentum spreading around the world to support hydrogen as a key \\ndriver of future deep decarbonisation \\n \\nThe release of national strategies and roadmaps promoting hydrogen development \\nhas seen unprecedented momentum during the last two y\\nears.

Several EU Member States \\nhave \\nnow \\ncommunicated their hydrogen strategies (e.g. Germany, France,\\n \\nSpain, \\nPortugal and the Netherlands)\\n, while\\n \\nNorway and the UK \\nhave \\nalso developed their \\nown \\nroadmaps, leveraging on \\nthe\\n \\nlarge potential to use synergies between hydrogen \\nand their existing gas resources and assets. Other countries have either published \\nth\\neir strategies (e.g. Canada, Russia, Colombia and Chile), or are in the process of \\ndeveloping a comprehensive roadmap (e.g. China, the US, Italy, Argentina). In the \\nMiddle East and North Africa, Saudi Arabia and the UAE are positioning themselves \\nas \\nkey\\n \\nex\\nporters\\n \\nof hydrogen\\n.

Firstly, the intensity of focu\\ns on green hydrogen is higher in the EU than in \\nother countries. \\nH\\nydrogen for passenger cars is \\nunder more consideration \\nin \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\n(e.g. China, South Korea), compared to other regions.

The development of \\nblue hydrogen is targeted in the UK, Norway, Canada and \\nthe \\nMENA region, given \\nthe resources and the availability of mature fields for storing \\nCO\\n2\\n.  Furthermore, some \\nEuropean and Asian consuming countries (e.g. \\nGermany, Japan) envision significant \\nhydrogen imports, while countries \\nsuch as\\n \\nRussia, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the \\nUAE \\nare \\nstriv\\ning\\n \\nto build an export\\n-\\noriented supply chain.

During the last year, the EU has \\nenhanced its climate ambition by updating its previous GHGs emissions reduction \\ntargets from 40% to 55%\\n,\\n \\ncompared to 1990. It has also committed to reach\\ning\\n \\ncarbon neutrality by 2\\n050, which has been enshrined in climate law.

The latter allocates \\nin excess of\\n \\nE\\nUR\\n \\n750 b\\nillion\\n \\nof \\nfunds in addition to the EU 2021\\n-\\n2027 budget, to support economic \\nrecovery, with 37% of this fund targeting the green transition. \\n \\nThe EU policies and measures cascade\\n \\ndown to\\n \\nthe \\nM\\nember \\nS\\ntate (MS)\\n \\nlevel, \\nnotably through the implementation of Final National Energy and Climate \\nPlans,\\n \\n(\\nNECP)\\n \\nthe most recent\\n \\nversion \\nof which was \\nreleased in 2020. The EU assessment \\nshows that the cumulative targets and efforts \\nof the MS \\nare still not supportin\\ng a \\ntrajectory \\nthat\\n \\nis compatible with the new 55% emissions reduction target. \\n \\nThe 2021 GGO edition assumes that the release of \\nthe \\n\\nencourage \\na \\nreinforced effort from \\nthe \\nMS. This effort will support several countries \\nto achieve their final NECP decarbonisation commitments, published in 2020. \\nNevertheless, the GGO assumes that MS policies are still not in line with the new \\n \\n62\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n55% reduction target\\n, nor\\n \\nwith the carbon neutralit\\ny pathway. \\nThe technical and \\neconomic challenges faced by the MS in order to deploy the required aggressive \\ndecarbonisation options, together with \\nthe \\ndisparity between various MS level of \\nprogress, \\nare assumed to \\nbe still hampering the achievement of the \\ngreen deal \\nambition. \\n \\nNatural gas: still part of the energy transition equation, but increasing policy \\npressure to decarbonise this fuel and repurpose gas infrastructures\\n \\nThe recent gas policy developments indicate that the EU continues to consider \\nnatural\\n \\ngas as a key contributor to the energy transition, despite clear opposition \\nexpressed by various stakeholders. \\nThe \\nEU ministers agreed\\n \\nto extend support \\n(e.g. \\nfast\\n-\\ntrack authorisation procedure) \\nfor some cross\\n-\\nborder gas infrastructures \\nwith\\nin \\nthe framework of \\nthe\\n \\nTEN\\n-\\nE policy, which defines projects of common interests. \\nFurthermore, the EU has kept the door open for gas\\n-\\nconsuming activities (e.g. gas\\n-\\nfired power plants and gas\\n-\\nbased heat) to be included in the Sustainable Finance \\nTaxonomy\\n \\n(9\\n)\\n. The latter classifies the sustainable economic activities that might \\nbenefit from public funding and policy incentives. \\n \\nPragmatically, natural gas, as the cleanest fossil fuel, has a role to play in Europe, \\nsince it \\ncan\\n \\ncompensate \\nfor \\nthe accelerated p\\nhasing\\n-\\nout of coal and the potential \\ndecline of the old nuclear fleet. Gas\\n-\\nfired power plants also offer \\nan \\nundeniable \\nadvantage in maintaining the reliability of \\nthe \\nelectricity supply and stability of \\nthe \\npower grid, \\ngiven\\n \\nthe increasing penetration of r\\nenewables. Although several options \\nexist for improving flexibility (e.g. battery and hydropower storages\\n,\\n \\ndemand\\n-\\nside \\nresponse, hydrogen), these options \\nare \\nstill experienc\\ning\\n \\nsignificant technical and \\neconomic challenges and might not be available at the\\n \\nrequired scale to meet the \\nhuge flexibility requirements. Gas\\n-\\nfired power plants can \\nprovide\\n \\nthe appropriate \\nflexible response. \\n \\nThere is a clear split between \\nthe\\n \\nvarious EU \\nMS\\n \\naround the future role of natural gas \\nin \\na \\nclimate\\n-\\nneutral Europe. Several ea\\nst European countries have explicitly \\nexpressed the importance of this fuel in their move away from coal. They \\nhave argued \\nthat natural gas can support them in reducing emissions immediately and cost\\n-\\neffectively with existing and well\\n-\\nknown technologies, a\\nnd in balancing renewables \\nintermittency\\n \\n(10)\\n. For \\nthese countries\\n, discontinuing support to the development of \\ngas infrastructures will make the\\nir\\n \\neffort\\ns\\n \\nto \\ncombat\\n \\nclimate change very expensive. \\nSome c\\nountries \\nmay\\n \\nnot \\nbe able to \\nafford it, especially in \\nthe context of the large \\neconomic difficulties experienced after the COVID\\n-\\n19 outbreak.\\n \\nNevertheless, there is increasing policy pressure \\nwith\\nin the EU to decarbonise gas \\nand repurpose gas infrastructures to accommodate the new low\\n-\\ncarbon gases, \\nincluding \\nhydrogen, biomethane and synthetic gas. The decarbonisation of fossil gas \\ncan be achieved by converting it to hydrogen (through reforming or pyrolysis) or by \\n \\n63\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nreducing the emissions stemming from its value chain\\n,\\n \\nincluding \\nvia\\n \\nthe deployment \\nof \\nCCUS\\n \\n \\nMoreov\\ner, other policy measures have recently \\nbeen \\n\\n\\nput\\n \\nconsiderable pressure on natural gas and \\nprovide\\n \\na \\npush \\ntowards\\n \\nits decarbonisation. These include reforms of the EU ETS system\\n,\\n \\na \\nreview of fossil \\nfuels taxation\\n, the\\n \\nproposal \\nfor a new\\n \\nCarbon Border Adjustment \\nMechanism (\\nCBAM\\n),\\n \\nas well as \\na new\\n \\nmethane strategy.  The latter proposes \\nmandatory actions for data \\nm\\neasurement, \\nr\\neporting and \\nv\\nerification (MRV), and for \\nimproving \\nl\\neak \\nd\\netection and \\nr\\nepair (LDAR). It also suggests the creation of an \\ninternational methane emissions observatory and a methane supply index for the \\nvarious gas producers and suppliers of the EU. \\n \\nThe GGO considers that the implementation of strengthened decarbonisation polic\\nies \\nwill add new economic burdens \\nfor\\n \\ngas supply and negatively affect gas demand, \\nespecially after 2030. Nevertheless, it assumes that gas \\nwill \\ncontinue to play a critical \\nlong\\n-\\nterm role, particularly in east European countries. Moreover, the GGO assumes \\nthe implementation of policy support to low\\n-\\ncarbon gases will drive a considerable \\nincrease \\nin demand for\\n \\nnew decarbonised gases, particularly hydrogen. Gas\\n-\\nbased \\nhydrogen will play a role over the next decade but will be substantially challenged by \\nrenewa\\nbles\\n-\\nbased gas beyond 2030.  \\n \\nRevision of renewables\\n \\ntarget\\n: a strong push with updated targets, but \\nimplementation at \\nthe \\ncountry level remains a key uncertainty \\n \\n\\nF\\n\\nrenewabl\\nes penetration target from \\na \\n32% share in the overall energy mix to 40% by \\n2030. \\nSpecifically, t\\nhe proposal builds on the EU\\n\\n \\nvision for an integrated energy \\nsystem, which considers the synergies between various energy carriers, \\ninfrastructures and sector\\ns to manage and integrate renewables in\\nto\\n \\nthe power and \\nenergy systems.\\n \\nThe EC \\nhas \\nalso proposed \\na\\n \\nscale\\n-\\nup \\nof \\nefforts \\nto \\nsupport renewables penetration in \\nthe \\nnon\\n-\\npower sector, by setting more ambitious targets for heating and cooling (i.e. \\na \\nbinding 1.1%\\n \\nannual increase of renewables)\\n, for\\n \\nindustry (i.e. \\na \\n1.1% annual \\nincrease of renewables) and transport (i.e. \\na reduction of \\n13% \\nin \\nGHG intensity \\ncompared to an emissions\\n-\\nbased benchmark\\n,\\n \\nby 2030). For the transport sector, the \\nEC \\nhas \\nindicated that the ne\\nw target is equivalent to \\na \\n28% share of renewables in \\ntransport, including biofuels, renewable\\n \\nelectricity and renewable\\n \\nhydrogen. This \\nmarks a substantial increase compared to the previous \\ntarget, which was \\n14% by \\n2030. To support these targets, the EC \\nh\\nas \\nrecommended boosting electrification \\nand renewable\\n \\nhydrogen\\n \\nand is also recommending the acceleration of granting \\npermits for \\nrenewable projects \\nas well as\\n \\nincentivising cooperation between MS.  \\n \\n \\n64\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nThe collective targets stated by the EC need to be suppor\\nted by country\\n-\\nlevel policies \\nand efforts. Several MS have posted enhanced renewables targets in their Final \\nNECPS compared to their previous plans. The German NECP \\naims to\\n \\nreach\\n \\na share \\nof 30% renewable\\ns\\n \\npenetration by 2030\\n \\nand t\\nhe country has passed a \\nnew\\n,\\n \\nmore \\nambitious climate law that aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. Renewables \\nare set to play a central role and the country has unveiled a new target to meet 65% \\nof its power generation from renewable sources by 2030\\n \\n(11)\\n.  \\n \\nFrance, Spain and\\n \\nItaly have also set ambitious renewables targets. Spain \\nhas \\nstated \\nan objective to achieve 74% renewables in \\nits\\n \\npower mix and 42% in \\nits \\nfinal energy \\nconsumption by 2030. It \\nalso \\nenvisions full rel\\niance\\n \\non renewables for power \\ngeneration by 2050. Italy \\ni\\ns \\ntarget\\ning\\n \\n40% renewables by 2030 and recently \\nunveiled \\na plan to add 40 GW capacity by 2050. France has also made a bold move towards \\nenhancing its renewables penetration\\n, setting\\n \\na goal to achieve \\n33% renewables\\n \\nshare by 2030 and to completely decarboni\\nse its power generation by 2050. \\n \\nDespite these \\nambitious\\n \\ncommitments towards enhancing renewable energy \\nby\\n \\nEuropean countries, progress \\ncould\\n \\nbe hindered by numerous challenges. These \\ninclude the technical and economic constrain\\nt\\ns of integrating \\na\\n \\nlarge s\\nhare of \\nrenewables\\n;\\n \\nadministrative hurdles\\n;\\n \\nregulatory barriers and inconsistencies at MS \\nlevel\\n; the\\n \\navailability of land\\n; \\npopulation resistance to large\\n-\\nscale projects\\n,\\n \\nas well as \\nthe reduction of subsidies that \\nwill \\nincrease the risks for renewables proj\\nects \\ndevelopers. \\nWith\\n \\nthese barriers, \\nthe \\nintegration of intermittent renewables remains a \\nserious challenge \\nfor\\n \\nthe EU, given the huge need to reinforce power networks and \\nto scale\\n-\\nup various balancing options (including batteries). The EC\\n\\n \\nproposal to d\\neal \\nwith integration through the reconfiguration of energy systems around \\ndecentralisation, digitalisation and improved flexibility might not \\nbe \\nan easy task for \\nthe \\nvarious MS. This is due to several existing \\ninherent\\n \\nbarriers \\n(e.g. \\nlack of \\ntechnical \\nskil\\nls\\n,\\n \\nsectoral organisations, economic constraints) and to the strong disparity \\nbetween \\nlevels of development between \\nMS \\nand \\ntheir \\ncapability to roll out new \\nconfigurations of \\ntheir \\nenergy systems. \\n \\nTaking into account the various challenges and recent polic\\ny developments, the GGO \\nassumes that the EU will not achieve \\nits\\n \\nproposed target in the revised renewables \\ndirective, although it is well on track to meet the target of the current directive. It \\npresumes\\n \\nthat several MS countries will meet their 2030 NECP \\nrenewables targets \\n(as published in 2020)\\n, but b\\ny 2050, the GGO assumes that countries are not on track \\nto achieve full decarbonisation of their power system\\ns\\n. The GGO assumes that \\ncountries will \\nsubstantially \\nadvance the penetration of renewables in \\nthe \\nnon\\n-\\npower \\nsector, driven by strengthened targets and the implementation of significant policy \\nsupport, particularly to renewables\\n-\\nbased electricity and hydrogen, used notably in \\ntransport and industries \\n \\n \\n65\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nEnergy efficiency: a proposed revision of the effici\\nency directive to deal with \\nslower than expected progress \\n \\nThe EC has proposed to enhance \\nits\\n \\nenergy efficiency ambition by strengthening the \\ncollective 2030 target and mak\\ning\\n \\nit binding for the EU Member States. The new \\ntarget aims \\nto\\n \\nreduc\\ne\\n \\nprimary energ\\ny consumption by 39% compared to a baseline \\nscenario (the current non\\n-\\nbinding target, enshrined in the Energy Efficiency Directive, \\nis 32.5%). The new 2030 target is equivalent to limit\\ning\\n \\nprimary energy demand at \\n1023 Mtoe. \\n \\nThe EC proposal gives \\na \\nfurthe\\nr push to energy efficiency. It intervenes in a context \\nwhere recent assessments have shown a mismatch between the MS national targets, \\nthe NECPs policies supporting these targets and the collective EU ambition stated in \\nthe current efficiency directive\\n \\n(1\\n2)\\n.   \\nE\\nfficiency progress \\nby the MS \\nand their policy \\nefforts are \\nnot \\ndeemed \\nto be\\n \\nin line with the expectations of the EU, which has already \\n\\nle\\n. \\nThis\\n \\nacknowledges \\nthe central role of efficienc\\ny in the EU energy transition and \\nits \\ncarbon mitigation \\nactions. \\n \\nSeveral measures are \\nunder \\nconsider\\nation\\n \\nto support accelerated efficiency \\nimprovements\\n,\\n \\nincluding updating the energy efficiency obligations scheme for MS \\nenergy retailers (1.5% annual savi\\nng for the period 2024\\n-\\n2030)\\n,\\n \\na revision of the \\nenergy performance for \\nthe \\nbuilding\\ns\\n \\ndirective\\n,\\n \\naccelerating \\nthe pace of \\nrenovation \\nfor old buildings\\n,\\n \\nrevising energy products taxation\\n \\nand\\n \\nreinforcing emissions \\nstandards for vehicles. \\n \\nAt the MS level, mul\\ntiple national actions are \\nbeing \\nundertaken to support energy \\nefficiency, including specifically those under the post\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 recovery packages. \\nFor instance, Germany \\nhas \\nannounced a renovation program\\nme\\n \\nof \\nEur\\no\\n \\n2.5 billion \\nfor buildings\\n, while\\n \\nItaly \\nhas \\nbenefited from strong support from the Next\\n \\nGeneration\\n \\nEU funding to undertake efficiency actions, including pushing for digitalisation and \\nsmart technologies. Poland is also leveraging its National Fund for Environmental \\nProtection and Water Management to\\n \\nsupport efficiency improvements \\nin\\n \\nbuildings \\nand heating equipment. \\n \\nThe GGO assumes that countries will implement the policies highlighted in their \\nNECPs as well as the various recovery measures \\nwhich \\ntarget efficiency. This will \\ndrive efficiency improve\\nments, particularly in the building sector, which is set to \\nsee \\nan\\n \\nenhanced \\npace of \\nrenovation and \\na \\nlarger uptake of more efficient equipment. The \\nGGO revises downwards \\nthe\\n \\nprimary energy intensity of the EU compared to the \\nprevious edition, but the efficiency target, envisioned in \\nthe \\nnewly proposed efficiency \\ndirective\\n,\\n \\nwill \\nstill \\nnot be achieved. \\nThe d\\nisparity between countries\\n\\n \\neffort\\ns\\n \\nand \\nthe \\nchallenges \\nthey face \\nstill \\nhampers\\n \\nmeeting this enhanced efficiency ambition.\\n \\n \\n66\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nElectrification and hydrogen: increasingly attractive options to support long\\n-\\nterm deep decarbonisation\\n \\n \\nElectrification is supported in the EU in various sectors\\n, in\\n \\nparticular mobility and \\nheating servic\\nes. The EC estimates a potential \\nfor\\n \\na \\nmore than 50% share of \\nelectricity in heating demand for buildings\\n \\n(13)\\n. For electric mobility, the EC has \\nunveiled a target to reach 30 million zero\\n-\\nemission vehicles (ZEVs), \\nincluding mostly \\nEVs by 2030\\n \\nin its smart\\n \\nmobility strategy published in December 2020\\n. \\nTo support \\nthis goal, the EU \\nis \\nconsider\\ning\\n \\nseveral policy instruments including scaling\\n \\nup \\ncharging infrastructures\\n,\\n \\nadjusting taxation for fossil fuels\\n,\\n \\nreinforcing emissions \\nstandards\\n \\nand banning sales of n\\new petrol and diesel cars by 2035,\\n \\nas well as other \\nincentives aimed at supporting EV manufacturers and users. \\n \\n \\nFor EV producers, the EU has already introduced a ZLEV emissions credit system, \\nwhich enables them to benefit from emissions credits if the \\nZLEV share in their new \\nsales is higher than 15% by 2025 and 35% by 2030 (\\nwith a \\n30% target for vans).  \\nSeveral MS states have pledged to reach 100% ZEV of new sales for light\\n-\\nduty \\nvehicles (e.g. Sweden by 2030\\n,\\n \\nFrance and Spain by 2040\\n,\\n \\nGermany by 2050). \\nThey \\nare implementing various measures \\nto support EVs \\nincluding the ones under the \\npost\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 stimulus package. For instance, Germany and France have allocated \\nsubstantial funding for EV production to support the recovery of their national \\nautomotive in\\ndustry. \\n \\n \\nThe GGO factors in reinforced EV policies and assumes European countries will \\nachieve a large EV penetration\\n. Despite this progress, the EU is not on track to meet \\nits 30 million ZEV target due to several barriers\\n,\\n \\nincluding the disparity in \\ninfr\\nastructure deployment\\n \\nand\\n \\nthe range of \\nthe \\nvehicles\\n,\\n \\nas well as the high cost of \\nvehicles and batteries underpinned by the constraints on material (lithium) \\nproduction. \\nNonetheless, l\\now emissions vehicles including hybrid vehicles will still \\nhave a considerable share \\nof\\n \\nnew sales. \\nThe GGO assumes a ban of new petrol and \\ndiesel sales after 2040.\\n \\n \\nBesides policy support \\nfor\\n \\nelectrification, hydrogen has also received a push with the \\nadop\\ntion of the EU hydrogen strategy, supplemented by strategies and initiatives \\nannounced at \\na \\nMS level (e.g. \\nby \\nGermany\\n,\\n \\nFrance\\n,\\n \\nItaly and the Netherlands). The \\nkey orientations that \\nare clear\\n \\nwhen examining all these strategies are i) a large focus \\non green\\n \\nhydrogen with a vision to use this energy carrier as a lever for intermittent \\nrenewables integration; ii) a recognition of the role of blue hydrogen (gas\\n-\\nbased \\nhydrogen paired with CCS) as a competitive and viable option; iii) an orientation to \\ndirect hyd\\nrogen demand towards two end\\n-\\nuse sectors: energy\\n-\\nintensive industries \\nand transport; iv) a vision to use \\nthe \\nhydrogen economy as a vector \\nfor\\n \\nfostering \\neconomic growth and recovering from the current COVID\\n-\\n19 crisis. \\n \\n \\nThe EU strategy aims to install \\n4\\n0 GW\\n \\nof renewable hydrogen capacity, producing \\n10 \\nmillion \\ntons of hydrogen by 2030. For the MS, five countries \\n(\\nGermany, France, \\nItaly, Spain and the Netherlands\\n)\\n \\nhave stated targets to build cumulatively more than \\n \\n67\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n25 GW of electrolyser capacity by 2030.

The \\nGGO assumes that\\n \\nthe\\n \\nimplementation of hydrogen policy support will drive an \\nincrease in the deployment of hydrogen conversion projects and infrastructures\\n, \\nNevertheless, the various technical and economic challenges for\\n \\nexecuting these \\nprojects (e.g. \\nthe \\nefficiency of conversion processes\\n,\\n \\nhigh upfront costs\\n,\\n \\nthe \\nimportant \\nneed for renewable energy to secure \\na \\nclean electric\\nity\\n \\nsupply) will \\nresult in\\n \\na \\nsubstantial mismatch with the very ambitious EU target. \\nG\\nas\\n-\\nbased hyd\\nrogen \\nconversion is assumed to play some role within the EU given the competitiveness, \\nscalability and existing synergies with existing gas infrastructures.  \\n \\n \\nUnited Kingdom\\n \\nA strong policy push for decarbonisation with very ambitious climate targets \\nand \\ncommitments\\n \\n \\nThe UK government has recently adopted milestone policy actions aim\\ned\\n \\nat \\nreinforcing its climate commitments. \\nThe\\n \\ncountry \\nhas \\npledged to reduce emissions \\nby 68% by 2030, compared to 1990, revising upwards its previous target \\nof\\n \\na \\n57% \\nreduction\\n. It \\nhas \\nalso adopted a new target \\nwhich \\npush\\nes\\n \\nthe mitigation effort \\nfurther, \\nto reach \\na \\n78% reduction by 2035. This target \\nhas been\\n \\nproposed in the framework \\nof the 6\\nth\\n \\nC\\narbon \\nB\\nudget for the period 2033\\n-\\n2037, adopted in June 2021. \\nC\\narbon \\nbudgets are lega\\nlly binding instruments, which aim to define an emission\\ns\\n \\ncap for \\nfive\\n-\\nyear successive periods, and \\nwhich \\nset a pathway towards net\\n-\\nzero emissions. \\nThe UK has already enforced its commitment to achiev\\ning\\n \\ncarbon neutrality into law \\nin 2019.  \\n \\n \\nTo support th\\nese \\nproposals\\n, the government \\npublished\\n \\nan energy white paper\\n \\n(14) in \\nDecember 2020\\n. \\nThis\\n \\nconsiders a set of priorities and actions \\nof which the most \\nnotable are\\n: scaling up offshore wind development with a target to reach 40 GW by \\n2030;  supporting the es\\ntablishment of low\\n-\\ncarbon industrial clusters with CCS/CCUS \\ndeployment; developing the UK ETS; reinforcing \\nthe \\nenergy performance of \\nbuildings; ensuring that new buildings are zero\\n-\\ncarbon ready; banning new petrol and \\ndiesel cars sales by 2030; accelerating the decarbonisation of \\nthe \\noil and gas \\nupstream sector, with a key focus on reducing methane emissions; speed\\ning up \\n \\n68\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\ndecisions for nuclear developments;\\n \\nand\\n \\npromoting electrification of \\nthe \\nheating and \\nhydrogen economy. \\n \\nIn line with these priorities, the government \\nhas undertaken\\n \\nconcrete measures since \\nthe publication of the last GGO edition\\n. It has\\n \\nlaunched its\\n \\nnew post\\n-\\nBrexit ETS \\nsystem in January 2021, bas\\ned\\n \\n\\nIt \\nhas \\nalso advanced the deadline for \\nthe phasing out of \\ncoal, reinforc\\ned\\n \\nthe rules to \\nmitigate emissions \\nfrom\\n \\nthe \\noil and gas upstream sector, \\nand \\nadva\\nnced power sector \\nreforms to boost renewables and improve their integration. The UK government \\nalso \\nreleased \\nits\\n \\nhydrogen national strategy on August 2021, which set\\ns\\n \\na target to install \\n5 GW of low\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The strategy\\n \\noutlined the \\nfocus of the UK on supporting hydrogen in industrial sectors, residential heating and \\nsome transport segments. It envisions building industrial clusters, where hydrogen \\ncan be produced either by using renewables or natural gas paired with CCS\\n. \\n \\nThe GGO takes into account the \\n\\nrecent reinforced climate commitments and \\nmeasures, which will drive a strong downward revision of emissions compared to the \\nlast GGO edition. Nevertheless, it assumes that the country will miss its very \\nambitious tar\\ngets. To overcome this gap, the UK needs to further accelerate the \\nimplementation of policies and overcome technical and economic challenges faced \\nby various decarbonisation options (e.g. renewables, nuclear, hydrogen and \\nefficiency), a\\n \\nfact which\\n \\nwas high\\nlighted in a recent assessment \\nby\\n \\nthe Committee on \\nClimate Change\\n \\n(15)\\n. \\n \\nChina\\n \\nThe 14\\nth\\n \\nFive\\n-\\nyear \\nE\\nnergy \\nP\\nlan:  key updates in energy and climate targets and \\nfurther commitment to support energy security\\n \\nIn March 2021 t\\nhe Chinese government released\\n \\na general policy document outlining \\nthe main goals and \\nguidelines\\n \\nof the 14\\nth\\n \\nFive\\n-\\nYear Plan (FYP) for the period 2021\\n-\\n2025\\n \\n(20)\\n. This document is set to be followed by more detailed plans stating the \\nvarious sectoral targets and policy instruments that \\nwi\\nll \\nsupport the main goals.  \\n \\nIn the new 14\\nth\\n \\nFYP, China \\nhas \\nrevised its energy and climate targets. It \\nhas \\ncommitted to reduc\\ning the\\n \\ncarbon and energy intensities of \\nits \\nGDP by 18% and \\n13.5% \\nrespectively by\\n \\n2025\\n,\\n \\ncompared to 2020 levels, and to increase th\\ne share of \\nnon\\n-\\nfossil fuels to 20% by 2025. China has also set a target to increase \\nits \\nnuclear \\ncapacity from 52 GW in 2020 to 70 GW by 2025 and to generate 16.5% of its \\nelectricity from solar and wind by 2025. \\n \\nThe policy effort and orientations highlight\\ned in the 14\\nth\\n \\nFYP follow previous \\nannouncements by President Xi Jinping to peak emissions before 2030 and to \\nachieve carbon neutrality by 2060. China has proposed \\nan\\n \\nenhance\\nment of\\n \\nits NDC\\ns\\n \\n \\n69\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nambition by 2030, \\nby\\n \\nconsidering a reduction of its carbon intens\\nity by over 65% \\ncompared to 2005 (\\nthe \\nprevious target was between 60\\n-\\n65%).\\n \\nEnsuring \\nthe\\n \\nsecurity of supply and reducing over\\n-\\nreliance on energy imports appear \\nas key priorities in the 14\\nth\\n \\nFYP. The latter sets a target \\nfor\\n \\ndomestic production of all \\nenergy\\n \\nsources of at least 4.6 billion \\ntons\\n \\ncoal equivalent (tce). It also outline\\ns\\n \\nthe \\ndesire to reinforce \\nthe \\ndiversification of energy sources and supplies and encourage\\ns\\n \\ndomestic production of energy equipment (e.g. deep\\n-\\nsea oil and gas production \\nplatforms)\\n, \\nto\\n \\nreduce costs and support the country\\n\\n \\noil and gas production. \\n \\nNatural gas continues to benefit from policy support, with a significant focus \\non promoting \\na \\nstable and reliable gas supply\\n \\nChina \\nis \\npursu\\ning\\n \\na\\n \\nsupportive policy towards natural gas, which \\nis\\n \\nconfirmed in the \\n14\\nth\\n \\nFYP orientations. Natural gas fits with the main priorities highlighted in the FYP, \\nincluding controlling air pollution\\n,\\n \\nreducing emissions\\n,\\n \\nintegrating intermittent \\nrenewables\\n, \\nimproving energy efficiency and providing a secure and diversified \\nenergy supply. \\n \\nFurthermore, recent policy measures indicate that promoting \\na \\nreliable gas supply \\nhas gained \\nmore\\n \\nsignifican\\nce\\n. The government has advanced its gas market and \\npricing reform\\ns, notably through \\nthe installation of \\nnew market\\n-\\nbased mechanisms \\nfor pipeline tariffs under the supervision of the recently established pipeline company \\n(Pipechina). It has also reinforced incentives for building infrastructures (e.g. \\naccelerated permitt\\ning), and extended VAT rebates for the supply of gas and the \\nprocurement of gas\\n-\\nrelated equipment. Furthermore, other measures \\nhave been \\nannounced which \\naim \\nat\\n \\nboost\\ning\\n \\nupstream developments, \\nin \\nadd\\nition\\n \\nto the recent \\nopening up of the sector to foreign co\\nmpanies. These \\nmeasures \\ninclude the \\nintensification of bidding rounds for exploration and development\\n,\\n \\nand the \\nintroduction of subsidies and relaxed regulations for shale gas developments. For \\ninstance, six new shale gas exploration blocks have been offere\\nd recently \\nin\\n \\nthe \\nGuizhou province. \\n \\nThe \\nNational Development and Reform Commission (\\nNDRC\\n)\\n \\nhas \\nreleased a policy \\ndocument confirming its ambition to deepen liberalisation reforms and improve gas \\nprice stability\\n \\n(16)\\n, but experts and energy observers argue \\nthat China\\n\\n \\npolicy push \\nfor more security of supply might slow this agenda and allocate more \\nof a \\nrole to the \\nnational gas companies. \\n \\nOn the demand side, reinforced emissions standards for pollutants (e.g. clean air \\npolicy) and the establishment of the n\\national ETS system are set to give a push to \\ngas demand in different sectors. The implementation of these policies will encourage \\nfurther coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas and oil\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching in different sectors. Moreover, gas for \\npower generation is \\nbeing \\nencouraged to s\\nupport increasing intermittent renewables \\ndevelopment. \\n \\n \\n70\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nThe GGO factors in gas supportive policies, and assumes that these policies \\nwill \\ncontribute to driv\\ning\\n \\nan increase in both demand and production of natural gas. \\nHowever, the GGO considers that the com\\npetition of alternative sources (e.g. \\nrenewables, clean coal and nuclear), and the technical and economic challenges \\nof \\nramp\\ning\\n \\nup domestic production will weigh on this progress over the long\\n \\nterm. China \\nis assumed not \\nto be \\non track to achieve the alread\\ny announced 15% gas penetration \\ntarget by 2030. \\n \\nIncreasing policy pressure to reduce \\n\\n, but rising power demand \\nand \\nsecurity of \\nsupply concerns contribute to maintain\\ning\\n \\ninterest for the fuel\\n \\n\\nintensity reduction target over the next decade will \\nput\\n \\nincreasing pressure on coal. \\nP\\nresident Xi Ji\\nn\\nping \\nhas \\nannounced that China will \\nplace\\n \\nstrict control\\ns\\n \\non coal\\n-\\nfired \\ngener\\nation projects\\n, \\nlimit\\ning their\\n \\nincrease over the \\nperiod of the \\n14\\nth\\n \\nFYP and \\nreducing the role of coal\\n \\nin subsequent plans. \\n \\nSince the publication of the last GGO edition, some key measures have been adopted \\nthat might restrict coal\\n\\n \\ndevelopment. Among the\\nm is the launch of the national ETS \\nsystem, in July 2021, which \\ninitially \\ninvolves the power sector\\n,\\n \\nbefore its extension to \\nother sectors including the coal\\n-\\nconsuming industries\\n.\\n \\nThe national ETS is expected \\nto cover more than one\\n-\\nthird of the country\\n\\n \\ne\\nmissions, building on the eight pilot \\nETS\\ns\\n, which have been \\nin existence\\n \\nsince 2011. Nevertheless, there is still \\nuncertainty regarding the stringency of this carbon market, since it does not set \\nexplicit caps on emissions allowances and allocate\\ns\\n \\nthese em\\nissions \\nfreely \\nto the \\nparticipating companies\\n \\n(\\n17\\n)\\n. \\nAs a result, \\nreference prices might keep moderate \\nvalues \\ninitially\\n, with potential growth over the medium to \\nlong\\n-\\nterm\\n \\nif\\n \\nmore \\nstrengthened mechanisms \\nare\\n \\ndeveloped. \\n \\nOther recent announcements and measur\\nes put significant pressure on coal. The \\n14\\nth\\n \\nFYP increased the binding benchmark of the \\n\\nShare of Days with Good Air \\nQuality\\n\\n. This might give additional motivation to strengthen pollution standards at \\nprovincial and urban levels, triggering more switchin\\ng from coal. Furthermore, the big \\nfive independent power producers (accounting for more than 44% of production \\ncapacity), \\nhave \\npledged to peak their carbon emissions by 2025. This \\nbuilds on \\nthe \\ngovernment\\n\\n \\ndecision to exclude coal\\n-\\nfired projects from \\nChin\\n\\nreen \\nB\\nond \\nfinancing mechanisms. \\n \\nDespite all the unfavourable drivers for coal, this fuel continues to receive some \\ninterest, particularly in the context of rising power demand; electricity supply \\nshortages experienced in some provinces and increased \\nsecurity of supply concerns. \\nR\\nising power demand has recently driven some provinces to resume \\nissuing \\npermit\\ns \\nfor \\nthe building of new coal\\n-\\nfired power plants and \\nto \\nrelax their emissions standards. \\nCoal still remains \\nthe main\\n \\ncompetitive source of electricity production in the country\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n71\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nMoreover, Chin\\nese\\n \\npolicymakers, including at \\na \\nprovincial level, still support \\ninvestment in \\ndomestic \\ncoal production. This support is not only underpinned by local \\ndevelopment priorities, but \\nalso by the need to secure coal suppl\\nies\\n\\nconcerns around supply security have been exacerbated by the increasing coal\\n-\\nfor\\n-\\npower demand and limited coal supply from Australia due to escalated tensions \\nbetween the two countries. To overcome th\\ne pressure on \\nthe \\ncoal market, the NDRC \\nhas allowed the reopening of more than 50 mines previously shut\\n \\ndown in the north. \\nThe Chinese government \\nis \\nalso support\\ning\\n \\nthe expansion of coal min\\ning\\n \\ncapacit\\ny\\n \\nto \\nreduce reliance on imports. \\n \\nEven though the gover\\nnment continues to give some support to coal, particularly for \\ndomestic production, the GGO assumes that the implementation of climate and clean \\nair restrictions will \\nresult in a \\npeak\\n \\nin coal demand and its decrease over the long\\n \\nterm. The GGO revises down\\nwards coal \\nuse \\nin China compared to the last edition.  \\n \\nDespite \\nthe \\nu\\npward revision of renewables and nuclear\\n, China is not on track \\nto meet its long\\n-\\nterm non\\n-\\nfossil penetration target \\n \\nThe 14\\nth\\n \\nFYP outlined new targets for renewables and nuclear to suppor\\nt a broader \\nobjective to achieve \\na \\n20% non\\n-\\nfossil share in the primary energy mix\\n \\nby 2025\\n. The \\nFYP \\nis \\naim\\ned\\n \\nat increasing nuclear capacity from 52 GW in 2020 to 70 GW by 2025 \\nand to generate 16.5% of electricity from solar and wind by 2025. By 2030, solar \\nand \\nwind additions are targeted to reach 1200 GW. \\n \\nAccelerating renewables penetration, specifically solar and wind\\n,\\n \\nhas been the \\ncornerstone of Chin\\n\\n \\nenergy policy. \\nThese renewables have\\n \\nbenefited from \\ngenerous subsidies and cost reductions \\nwhich have\\n \\ns\\npurred huge capacity \\ndevelopments, beyond the ability \\nof the system to integrate\\n \\nthe renewable electricity\\n \\nproduced\\n \\ninto the network. This has \\nled to a\\n \\nsignificant waste of intermittent \\nrenewable energy.\\n \\nThe government has \\nexhibited\\n \\na clear shift \\nin\\n \\nits renewable support schemes \\nby\\n \\nremoving subsidies and directing its efforts towards supporting more cost efficiency \\nand better integration of renewables in the power network. China \\nhas \\nannounced \\nan \\nend\\n \\nto \\nsubsidies for solar PV and onshore wind projects\\n \\nfrom 2021\\n, and is\\n \\ncount\\ning\\n \\non market\\n-\\nbased policy instruments to push renewables\\n,\\n \\nincluding auctioning and \\nrenewables obligations. For the latter, China \\nhas \\nunveiled an ambition to raise the \\nobligation for provincial power grid companies to purchase at le\\nast 40% of electricity \\nfrom non\\n-\\nfossil power plants. \\n \\nFurthermore, the government supports reinforcing the power transmission networks \\nand improving the flexibility of power systems to integrate renewables. The National \\nEnergy Agency has set, for the first\\n \\ntime, a target to achieve 30 GW of storage \\ncapacities, including various options such as batteries, pumped storage and power\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas options. The FYP envisions the construction of mega\\n-\\nscale clean energy \\n \\n72\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\ncomplexes \\nwhich can\\n \\nintegrate various energy sources\\n \\nusing synergies between \\nthem and improved storage capabilities. China \\nis \\nalso consider\\ning\\n \\ngas\\n-\\nfired power \\nplants as key contributors in backing up and balancing renewables intermittency. \\n \\nFor nuclear, the 14\\nth\\n \\nFYP proposes to intensify the addition of new\\n \\ncapacities \\nincluding coastal \\nsites \\nin order \\nto meet the stated target. The implementation will face \\nsome key hurdles including the permit process as well as technical issues. For \\ninstance, the new\\n-\\ngeneration EPR reactor ha\\ns\\n \\nfaced \\ntechnical \\nproblems that m\\night \\nhinder its safety and affect \\nits\\n \\nacceptability and the pace of nuclear deployment in the \\ncountry\\n \\n(\\n18\\n)\\n. Given these challenges, the GGO assumes that nuclear will \\nincrease \\nits share of the market\\n \\nbut will miss its announced target by some margin.  \\n \\nThe \\nGGO assumes that China is on track to achieve its solar and wind deployment \\ntargets by 2025 and 2030, driven by intensified auctions and renewables obligations \\nthat will compensate for the downside effect of \\nthe removal of \\nsubsidies. Over the \\nlonger\\n \\nterm, \\nrenewables will continue to expand, but the potential \\nfor\\n \\nprogress will be \\naffected by several challenges\\n. These \\ninclud\\ne \\nthe large\\n-\\nshare integration issue\\n,\\n \\nthe \\nhuge need to reinforce transmission networks\\n \\nand\\n \\nthe difficulties \\nin\\n \\nsubstantially \\nincreas\\ning\\n \\nla\\nrge\\n-\\nscale storage capacities\\n, as well as \\nthe competitiveness and \\nreliability of other options such as gas and\\n,\\n \\nto \\na \\nless\\ner\\n \\nextent\\n,\\n \\ncoal in meeting \\nthe \\n\\nconsiderable energy needs. \\nThe previously mentioned challenges together \\nwith \\nthe difficulties \\no\\nf\\n \\nramp\\ning\\n \\nup renewables sources \\nother \\nthan solar and wind and \\nto accelerate their penetration in \\nthe \\nnon\\n-\\npower sector\\n,\\n \\nwill \\n\\n \\nability \\nto meet its non\\n-\\nfossil fuel penetration targets at the different stated horizons (i.e. 20% \\nby 2025\\n,\\n \\n25% by 2030 and 50% by 2050).\\n \\nIndia \\n \\nThe government\\n\\n \\npriority \\nin\\n \\ndeal\\ning\\n \\nwith severe COVID\\n-\\n19 consequences \\nweighs on strengthening climate ambitions\\n \\nIndia has experienced a severe COVID\\n-\\n19 outbreak, specifically its second wave at \\nthe first half of 2021,\\n \\nwhich has substantially weakened social and economic \\nconditions in the country. In this context, the government\\n\\npriority has been \\nto mitigate the consequences of this crisis and rebuild the economy. It \\nhas \\nunveiled \\na huge recovery investment pl\\nan (around 11% of GDP) with a strong focus on \\ndomestic industrialisation that might drive an increase \\nin\\n \\nGHGs emissions\\n \\n(19)\\n. \\n \\nAlthough some recent stimulus packages are directed towards pushing for green \\nrecovery options (e.g. solar PV\\n, e\\nlectrification, b\\natteries), the country\\n \\nis\\n \\nshow\\ning\\n \\nsome reluctance to st\\nrengthen its climate ambitions, although it has recently pledged \\nto achieve carbon neutrality by 2070. \\nIndia remains sensitive to procuring affordable \\nand secure source\\ns\\n \\nof energy to fuel its post\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 economic rebound and long\\n-\\nterm progress. Coal is still considered a key contributor to meeting the growing \\nb\\naseload power generation needs.\\n \\n \\n73\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nIndia continues to expand its coal\\n-\\nfired power capacity, with around 35 GW expected \\nto be commissioned over\\n \\nthe next five years. The government \\nhas \\npostponed the \\nadoption of strengthened emissions norms for coal power plants, \\nin order \\nto relax the \\neconomic burdens amid the COVID\\n-\\n19 crisis. It \\nhas \\nalso adopted other measures \\nand reforms aimed at attracting inves\\ntment and supporting the development of \\ndomestic \\ncoal \\ncapacit\\ny\\n. The last coal mining auctions, conducted under the new coal \\nmining law in November 2020, resulted in the \\nallocation \\nof 19 mines among the 67 \\nproposed for bidding. Coal is expected to continue \\nto \\nplay a critical role in India\\n\\n \\nlong\\n-\\nterm energy mix, particularly in power generation and industry, given its large \\navailability and affordability. Nevertheless, a significant effort will be deployed to \\nadopt the High Efficient\\n-\\nLow Emissions technologi\\nes that will reduce pollution and \\nthe carbon footprint of coal\\n \\nuse\\n. \\n \\nGas market reforms and support to infrastructure will drive gas progress, but \\nit remains far from the gas\\n-\\nbased economy ambition.\\n \\nIndia \\nis \\npursu\\ning\\n \\nits gas\\n-\\nsupportive policy, driven by \\nits \\nambition to shift towards a \\ngas\\n-\\nbased economy and meet 15% of \\nits\\n \\nprimary energy\\n \\ndemand\\n \\nby natural gas. The \\ngovernment is implementing a plan to expand gas networks by two\\n-\\nthirds over the \\nnext decade and \\nha\\ns\\n \\nreleased a draft LNG policy envisioning more\\n \\nthan doubling \\nregasification capacity by 2040\\n \\n(20)\\n. It \\nhas \\nadvanced some key reforms \\nand \\nmeasures \\naim\\ned\\n \\nat encouraging competition for gas procurement and improving \\nmarket functioning. Among these \\nmeasures a\\nre: allowing companies to freely market \\ngas to t\\nheir clients using an online platform; introducing more market\\n-\\nbased pricing \\nschemes for gas sales including\\n \\nfrom domestic supply sources; \\nunveiling new tariff \\nrules for pipeline transport aiming for better transparency an\\nd uniformity; \\nreducing the \\nmonopol\\ny of distribution companies \\nfor \\ncity gas\\n \\nand launching the 11\\nth\\n \\ncity gas \\nlicensing round\\n. The government is moving towards more liberalisation of its gas \\nsector\\n, and t\\nhe launch of the Indian gas exchange in 2020 was a key step in this \\nregard. \\n \\n \\nFurthermore, policy support to domestic production has recently gained momentum \\nwith the introduction of economic and fiscal incentives and the acceleration of bidding \\nrounds under the Oil Licencing Acreage Policy (OLAP). India offered \\ntwenty\\n-\\none\\n \\noil \\nand g\\nas blocks for its OLAP 6\\nth\\n \\nbidding round launched in August 2021. The country \\nhas experienced a significant domestic production increase last year, driven by \\n\\n-\\nwater projects. \\n \\n \\nOn the demand side, \\nclean air policies \\nare\\n \\na key driver f\\nor \\nthe \\nlarger penetration of \\nnatural gas, particularly in the residential and transport sectors. For the transport \\nsector, India is substantially promoting \\nthe \\nconversion of vehicles to CNG and \\nsupporting the extension of gas refuelling stations. More than\\n \\n200 stations w\\nere\\n \\ninaugurated in June 2021. In the power generation sector, although there is a \\nlot of\\n \\nuncertainty around government supports to stranded gas power plants (or those \\noperating at low utilisation rates), their role in balancing renewables is\\n \\nincreasingly \\n \\n74\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nbeing \\nrecognised. The \\nmost recently\\n \\nreleased draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) \\noutlined the importance of gas\\n-\\nfired plants in \\ncreating\\n \\nflexibility and reliability of power \\ngrids \\ngiven\\n \\nthe substantial anticipated expansion of intermitten\\nt renewables\\n \\n(21)\\n. \\n \\n \\nAnother emerging sector, which \\nis \\nattract\\ning\\n \\nincreasing policy interest and might \\nprovide a considerable outlet for gas relates to the production of hydrogen.\\n \\nIn August \\n2021,\\n \\nIndia established\\n \\na national hydrogen mission in charge of d\\nrawing a roadmap \\nfor hydrogen development. Although recent official declarations unveiled \\nan\\n \\nambition \\nto develop a renewable\\n-\\nbased hydrogen hub, the hydrogen produced from natural \\ngas has \\nthe\\n \\npotential to make significant stride\\ns\\n \\nin the country. India migh\\nt leverage \\nits\\n \\nstrong existing chemical and refining industry to produce \\na \\nlarge volume of \\ncompetitive gas\\n-\\nbased hydrogen. \\n \\n \\nThe GGO assumes the implementat\\nion of gas supportive policies in the country \\nthat \\nwill drive an increase \\nin\\n \\ngas demand. Nevertheles\\ns, India is assumed to not be on \\ntrack to reach its 15% target by 2050, due mainly to competition \\nfrom \\nalternative \\nsources including coal and renewables. \\nOn the supply side, although the Indian policy \\neffort \\nwill \\ncontribute to increas\\ning\\n \\nthe level of domes\\ntic production, \\nthe\\n \\npace of \\nprogress is expected to be \\nmuch \\nlower than demand. The country could leverage \\naccessing a large base of international supply through pipeline and LNG imports.  \\nCooperation and reliable partnership\\ns\\n \\nwith gas producers \\nwill\\n \\nbe a k\\ney instrument \\nin\\n \\nsupport\\ning\\n \\nIndia in its quest to raise the contribution of gas in \\nits\\n \\nenergy configuration\\n \\nRenewables: a strong policy push with announced reforms to improve \\nintegration and deal with various market constraints\\n \\nIndia\\n\\n \\ninstalled \\ncapacity of \\nrenewables (excluding \\na \\nlarge hydropower\\n \\nshare\\n) \\nreached almost 100 GW as of July 2021, \\nan \\nincreas\\ne of\\n \\naround 40 GW in 2015. \\nDespite considerable progress, this level remains \\nwell below \\nthe stated target \\nof\\n \\nreach\\ning\\n \\n175 GW by 2022. The Indian P\\nr\\nime \\nM\\ninister \\nhas announced \\nan even \\nmore \\nambitious goal to achieve 450 GW by 2030. The government wants to accelerate the \\ndeployment of renewables to support these targets, counting on the intensification of \\nauctioning to catch up with delays caused by the \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 crisis, strengthening \\nthe \\nrenewable purchase obligations (RPOs) imposed \\non\\n \\npower distribution companies \\nand reforming the market to overcome the various barriers faced by the renewable\\ns\\n \\nsector. \\n \\nThe key challenges \\nfacing\\n \\nrenewables include adminis\\ntrative burdens, mainly due to \\nland acquisitions and delays in signing Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs); project \\nfunding issues; economic difficulties of distribution companies (DISCOMs) and weak \\ncompliance with the RPOs; power network bottlenecks and issu\\nes with grid access\\n \\nand the\\n \\nimposition of import duties on affordable Chinese renewables equipment. \\nThese challenges add to the integration \\nproblem\\n, which is underpinned by the lack of \\npower system flexibility. Indeed, the Indian power sector is dominated \\nby inflexible \\n \\n75\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ncoal\\n-\\nfired power plants and a lack of transmission capacities which might \\nresult in \\nsignificant wast\\nage\\n \\nof electricity\\n \\nproduced\\n. \\n \\nThe government has recently introduced a series of reforms to tackle these \\nchallenges including proposed amendme\\nnts to the electricity act. Several measures \\nare \\nbeing \\nconsidered\\n,\\n \\nsuch as setting transparent tariffs for DISCOMS\\n, \\nimproving \\ncompetition between them and enforcing their compliance with the RPOs\\n,\\n \\nenhancing \\nthe \\nfinancing capability of the Indian Renewable \\nDevelopment Agency \\n(IREDA) and\\n \\nlaunching a massive support program\\nme\\n \\nfor \\nthe \\ndomestic manufacturing of \\nrenewables equipment. Furthermore, India \\nhas \\nreleased a draft NEP that \\nemphasize\\ns\\n \\nthe need to accelerate the deployment of balancing options for \\nrenewabl\\nes integration. The government is encouraging bundled auctions that allow \\nthe \\npairing \\nof \\nrenewables with conventional flexible thermal power plants and storage\\n,\\n \\nhybrid solar\\n-\\nwind auctions\\n \\nand\\n \\ndeveloping demand\\n-\\nside management practices.

The Vietnamese draft \\nPDP 8 projects \\nan \\nincreas\\ne in\\n \\nthe share of gas to power from 15% in 2020 to almost \\n25% in 2045. The Philippines \\nE\\nnergy \\nP\\nlan (PEP 2017\\n-\\n204\\n0) anticipates gas to \\naccount for\\n \\nmore than 12% by 2040 (\\ncompared to \\naround 6% presently), while \\nMalaysia supports natural gas penetration, especially in non\\n-\\npower sectors (e.g. \\nindustry and transport). The recent announcement of Malaysia to decommission 7\\n \\nGW \\nof \\ncoal\\n-\\nfired capacit\\ny\\n \\noffer\\ns\\n \\nroom for both gas and renewables in the power \\nsector.  The country \\nis \\nstriv\\ning\\n \\nto advance its gas market reforms \\nin order \\nto renew \\nits gas reserve basis and overcome the significant challenges brought \\nabout \\nby \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19. \\n \\n \\n78\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nT\\nhere is an increasing policy orientation to impose limitations on coal, through \\nstrengthening emissions standards\\n,\\n \\nestablishing carbon pricing schemes (e.g. \\nthe\\n \\npilot ETS \\nscheme launched by Indonesia \\nin March 2021)\\n,\\n \\nand \\ncancelling \\nthe \\nconstruction of \\nnew p\\nrojects. These policy developments will offer room for more \\ncoal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching, although coal is still expected to \\nmaintain a\\n \\nrole in the future \\nenergy mix, amid competitiveness and security of supply concerns in the region\\n \\nAt \\na\\n \\nregional level, the ASEA\\nN action plan (\\nS\\ntage II) envis\\nages a\\n \\ncontinu\\nation of the\\n \\nreinforcement of \\ngas infrastructure integration, promoting open access to LNG \\nterminals and encouraging small\\n-\\nscale LNG as well as LNG as bunkering fuel\\n \\n(24)\\n. \\nThe GGO factors in supportive gas polici\\nes both at the ASEAN and national level\\ns\\n, \\nwhich\\n \\nwill drive increasing gas demand. The GGO assumes progress of gas market \\nreforms and cooperation in the region that will mitigate the decline of domestic gas \\nproduction and enable more integration \\nbetween\\n \\ngas infrastructures and markets. \\n \\nFurther push for renewables and efficiency to support cleaner and diversified \\nsupply and deal with growing energy needs\\n \\nThe ASEAN plan of action for energy cooperation for the period 2021\\n-\\n2025 (adopted \\nlast November) has \\nupdated the regional collective efficiency and \\nrenewable\\n \\npenetration targets. The plan stated a new target for reducing energy intensity by \\n32% in 2025 compared to 2005 (\\nthe \\np\\nre\\nvious target was 30%). It has also set a sub\\n-\\ntarget of achieving 25% renewables\\n \\nin installed power generation capacity, which \\nadds to the existing target for reaching \\na \\n23% share in the primary energy mix by \\n2025. \\n \\nFor renewables, Indonesia released a new electricity plan (RUPTL 2021\\n-\\n2030) to \\ninstall more than 20 GW new renewable cap\\nacity by 2030, with\\n \\na large focus on solar \\nenergy\\n \\n(25)\\n.\\n \\nThe country has targets to meet 28% of its power generation from \\nrenewables by 2038 and to reach more than 7 GW of geothermal capacity by 2030. \\nThe Philippines has also unveiled a \\nnew target in its la\\ntest version of the National \\nRenewable Energy Program (NREP) to reach 37% \\nrenewables for power\\n \\nby 2030 \\nand 54% by 2050. Meanwhile, Vietnam and Thailand have released more\\n \\nambitious \\nPower Development Plans (PDPs) for renewables, specifically for solar and w\\nind\\n \\n(26)(27)\\n.  (These anticipate achieving a renewables target of 45% of the installed \\ncapacity by \\n2045 for Vietnam and 37% by 2037\\n \\nfor Thailand, according to the draft \\nPDP 8 and PDP 2018\\n-\\n2037 respectively). In Vietnam, wind development is targeted \\nto achi\\neve a large expansion from 600 MW in 2020 to more than 18 GW by 2030. \\nThis huge increase is equivalent to more than tripling the previous PDP 7 planned \\nwind capacity.  \\n \\nThe GGO factors in \\nan\\n \\nupward revision of renewables plans in Southeast Asian \\ncountries, particularly solar and wind in the power sector. Nevertheless, it assumes \\nthat these countries are not on track to meet their very ambitious targets, due to the \\nvarious barriers hindering r\\nenewable progress in the region. These include access to \\n \\n79\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nfinancial resources to fund costly renewables projects; the availability of land, the still \\nweak regulatory framework and administrative barriers; the lack of power \\ntransmission networks; and the inf\\nlexibility of power systems \\nto accommodate \\nrenewables intermittency.  Southeast Asian countries are also assumed to miss by \\nsome margin the\\nir\\n \\ncollective renewables penetration target, although some measures \\nproposed under the ASEAN framework (e.g. support \\nto electricity network \\ndevelopment and integration) contribute to reduc\\ning\\n \\nthis gap.\\n \\nRegarding energy efficiency, Southeast Asian countries have achieved substantial \\nprogress in terms of energy intensity reduction. Despite a slowdown over the last year \\ndue\\n \\nto \\nthe \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 outbreak, the efficiency improvement achieved in the region \\nhas supported the recent upward revision of the ASEAN collective target. \\n \\nAt \\na\\n \\nnational level, all the countries in the region have already instated efficiency \\nprograms and target\\ns. These include, for instance, the Indonesian Master Plan for \\nEnergy Conservation (target of 25% reduction compared to BAU by 2025)\\n, \\nthe \\nEnergy Efficiency Plan for Thailand (30% energy intensity reduction by 2036)\\n \\nand \\nthe \\nVietnam National Energy Efficienc\\ny Program (target 8\\n-\\n10% savings between 2019 \\nand 2030).\\n \\nJapan and Korea\\n \\nNew revisions of the updated NDCs targets, marking new commitments to \\naccelerate \\nthe \\ndecarboni\\ns\\nation agenda\\n \\nJapan was amongst one of the first countries to submit an updated NDC in Mar\\nch \\n2020, keeping the same climate target as its previous NDC (i.e. 26% reduction by \\n2030 compared to 2013 level). South Korea released its NDC in December 2020, \\nposting a moderately revised target (i.e. remissions reduction by 24.4% in 2030 \\ncompared to 201\\n7). Nevertheless, the two countries have adjusted these NDCs \\ntargets and adopted new more ambitious ones ahead of the COP 26 conference in \\nNovember 2021. In their last adjustments, Japan pledged to reduce emissions by \\n46% over \\nthe \\n2013 level, almost doubli\\nng the previous commitment, while South \\nKorea unveiled a new objective to shrink emissions by 40% in comparison to 2017\\n.\\n \\nThe \\nupward revision of NDCs targets by \\nJapan and South Korea mark\\ns\\n \\nnew \\ncommitments to intensify efforts and accelerate their decarboni\\ns\\nation agenda. The \\ntwo governments have already unveiled their ambition\\ns\\n \\nto achieve carbon neutrality \\nby 2050. \\nIn December 2020, \\nJapan released \\nits\\n \\n\\n\\ns\\ned soc\\niety\\n \\n(28)\\n. \\nThe Japanese vision emphasi\\nz\\ned the need to redefine the role of coal and nuclear \\nwhich dominate the power generation mix\\n,\\n \\nexpand renewables\\n,\\n \\npromote carbon \\nrecycling and hydrogen\\n, \\nsupport efficient gas markets and us\\ne\\n \\npotential synergies \\nwith ot\\nher gases (hydrogen\\n,\\n \\nsynthetic \\nammonia and biogases).\\n \\n \\n80\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nSouth Korea also released its 2050 carbon\\n-\\nneutral strategy, which builds on two \\nKorean new deals (the Green New Deal and the Digital New Deal)\\n \\n(29)\\n. The \\ngovernment aims to support innovation and smart t\\nechnologies as key drivers for its \\nlow carbon energy transition. The main policy orientations outlined in the Korean \\nstrategy include: scaling up the use of clean power (including natural gas) and \\nhydrogen; energy efficiency improvements; deployment of car\\nbon sinks and removal \\ntechnologies. \\n \\nAlthough Japan and Korea have strengthened their climate commitments, the \\nimplementation of concrete actions and policies that support these targets remain\\ns\\n \\nvery challenging due to the large dependence of these countrie\\ns on hydrocarbon \\nsources and nuclear\\n,\\n \\nand the high cost of energy alternatives (e.g. renewables). The \\ncost of energy remain\\ns\\n \\nan important burden in a context where these export\\n-\\noriented \\ncountries \\nare striving\\n \\nto rebuild their economies \\nwhich have been \\naffe\\ncted by the \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 outbreak. In Japan, for instance, there is still strong resistance \\nto\\n \\nimposing \\na reinforced national\\n-\\nwide carbon pricing scheme, due to its perceived negative effect \\non the economy. \\n \\nNatural gas is set to \\nretain\\n \\na considerable role in \\nthe two countries, although it \\nwill be affected by the downward revision in the last \\nJapanese energy \\nplan \\n \\nIn July 2021, \\nJapan communicated its draft 6\\nth\\n \\nStrategic Energy Plan (SEP) which \\naims to \\noutline\\n \\nthe new \\nnational\\n \\nengagement towards \\na \\nless \\ncarbon\\n-\\nintensive energy \\nsystem\\n \\n(30)\\n. The plan revise\\ns\\n \\ndownwards the share of LNG in the 2030 power \\ngeneration mix from 27% to 20%. LNG is particularly squeezed by an aggressive \\nplanned renewables penetration  \\n \\nNevertheless, natural gas remains the clean fu\\nel that might support meeting baseload \\npower generation, in the context of large uncertainties on the future role \\no\\nf coal and \\nnuclear in Japan. This country has been engaged in a liberalization policy that aims \\nto improve electricity and gas market functio\\nning through increased competition. The \\ngovernment \\nalso envisions\\n, through advancing its gas market reforms, support\\ning\\n \\ninv\\nestment in gas infrastructures, \\na \\nreduc\\ntion in\\n \\nend\\n-\\nuse\\nr\\n \\nprices and ensur\\ning\\n \\nbetter \\nsecurity of supply, specifically after the recent \\ntension experienced \\nwith\\n \\ngas market \\nimports.   \\n \\nBas\\ned\\n \\non the recent orientation outlined in the draft SEP, the GGO revises gas \\ndemand \\ndownwards \\ncompared to the previous edition. However, it assumes that gas \\nwill \\nmaintain a\\n \\nconsiderable share in the long\\n-\\nterm primary energy mix, given its \\n\\npolicy orientation (Energy security\\n,\\n \\nEconomic efficiency\\n,\\n \\nEnvironmental sustainability \\nand Safety). The GGO\\n \\nassumes that the progress of gas liberali\\ns\\nation reforms \\nsupports \\nan \\nimproved flexibility of markets\\n, along with \\nbetter interconnectivity and \\naccess to infrastructures. This will improve the economic efficiency and security of \\n \\n81\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nsupply features of natural ga\\ns. Moreover, the implementation of deep gas \\ndecarboni\\ns\\nation options through hydrogen and CCUS will improve the environmental \\ncredentials of this fuel.\\n \\nSouth Korea has clearly stated a supportive policy for natural gas, by committing to \\nconvert a considerab\\nle part of its coal power plants to LNG, and \\nby \\nusing \\nCCUS\\n \\noptions to reduce the carbon footprint of the thermal processes. \\nT\\nhe \\nKorean \\ngovernment also \\nunveiled the Korean Green Taxonomy (K\\n-\\nTaxonomy) policy, \\nwhich \\naccepted LNG and blue hydrogen production a\\ns green classifications \\nuntil at least \\n2030\\n. \\nThe \\n\\n9\\nth\\n \\nenergy basic plan projects gas\\n-\\nfired capacities to grow from \\n41 GW in 2020 to 55 GW by 2034\\n \\n(31)\\n. Almost 13 GW of new gas power plants will \\nresult from the conversion of\\n \\npower plants\\n \\ninitially \\nplanned to run on \\ncoal\\n.\\n  \\n \\nThe\\nse\\n \\ngas power plants will play a critical role in balancing the increasing intermittent \\nrenewables, especially after South Korea revised downwards its ambition for battery \\nstorage due to several technical incidents. South Korea \\nalso supports natural gas in \\nthe \\nnon\\n-\\npower sector including in transport, as part of its clean air urban policy. \\n \\nFor South Korea, the GGO assumes implementation of the 9\\nth\\n \\nBasic Plan for \\nenergy \\nand other policy support schemes favo\\nu\\nring gas as a clean and\\n \\nless carbon\\n-\\nintensive \\nfuel\\n \\nStrengthened policy \\nrestrictions on\\n \\ncoal \\nwhile n\\nuclear \\nis challenged by safety\\n \\nrequirements and limitations on lifetime extensions\\n \\n \\nDespite the critical role of coal in supporting competitiveness and security of supply \\nin Japan \\nand Korea, recent policy documents in the two countries mark a clear \\norientation to\\nwards\\n \\nreinforc\\ning\\n \\nthe environmental limitations on coal. The Japanese \\ndraft SEP projects the fuel to reach 19% of the power generation mix by 2030 \\n(\\ncompared to \\n26% in the \\nprevious plan), while the Korean 9\\nth\\n \\nBasic P\\nlan envis\\nages\\n \\ncoal capacity peak\\ning\\n \\nby 2024 before starting a substantial decline. \\nI\\nnstalled \\ncoal \\ncapacity is set to reach almost 30 GW by 2034, dropping from the current installed \\ncapacity of around 40 GW. \\n \\nBoth\\n \\nJapan and Korea have unveiled their ambition\\ns\\n \\nto phase out old coal capacities, \\nbut the two countries still plan to add new power plants over the medium term. Clean \\ncoal technologies are leveraged as key options to cope with strengthened emissions \\nstandar\\nds. Increased restrictions including the implementation of carbon prices and \\ntaxes will affect the utilisation of coal, not only in the power sector but also in the \\nindustrial sector. In this regard, the GGO assumes the implementation of these coal\\n-\\nrestric\\ntive policies in Japan and South Korea will drive \\na \\ndownward revision of coal \\ncapacities compared to the previous GGO edition. \\n \\nAccording\\n \\nto\\n \\nthe \\nmost recently \\nreleased plans, nuclear is projected to continue \\nto \\nprovide\\n \\nstable baseload power generation over\\n \\nthe next 10 to 15 years in Japan and \\n \\n82\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nKorea. Japan reiterated its nuclear target of 20\\n-\\n22% by 2030, marking its commitment \\nto re\\n-\\ninstate its power capacity after \\nthe \\nFukushima disaster. Simultaneously, South \\nKorea, which has already announced \\nan\\n \\nintention \\nto substantially reduce its nuclear \\ncapacity\\n \\nby\\n \\nnot allowing nuclear life extension, unveiled a plan to keep around 19 \\nGW by 2034 (current capacity is 22 GW)\\n \\n(32)\\n. \\n \\nOver the longer term, there is significant uncertainty around the nuclear future in \\nJapan a\\nnd Korea. For Japan, the long\\n-\\nterm strategy adopted in 2019 indicated that \\nthe country will still use nuclear to support decarboni\\ns\\nation and security of supply. \\nThe recently communicated Green Growth Strategy outlined the government\\n\\n \\nefforts \\ntowards enhan\\ncing safety\\n \\nand\\n \\ndeveloping new nuclear technologies (small\\n-\\nscale \\nnuclear and fusion reactors). For Korea, the carbon\\n-\\nneutral strategy does not \\nexplicitly refer to nuclear as part of the long\\n-\\nterm decarboni\\ns\\nation solution. The \\ngovernment has already issued \\npolicy measures preventing lifetime extension \\nof \\nnuclear plants \\nbeyond 40 years\\n \\nand restricting the domestic construction of new \\nnuclear power plants. This will drive a substantial shrinkage of nuclear capacity, but \\nat\\n \\nthe same time, will put significant p\\nressure on the cost of electricity and the ability \\nto provide baseload power generation. Several voices in the country are claiming that \\nthe aggressive phase\\n-\\nout plan is not feasible economically and not in line with the \\ncarbon neutrality target. \\n \\nThe GGO \\nassumes the implementation of strengthened nuclear safety requirements \\nin Japan, which will drive a mismatch with the planned 2030 target. Lifetime extension \\nwill be significantly challenged and \\nwill support, in addition to the \\nlack of new \\nconstructions \\nth\\ne \\ndeep decline of nuclear by 2050. For South Korea, the GGO factors \\n\\nconstructions. It implements the 9\\nth\\n \\nBasic Energy Plan, where nuclear capacities are \\nset to drop to less than 20 GW by 2034. Although nuclear will shrink substantially \\nafter 2040 in South Korea, it is assumed that it will still play some role to provide a \\ndecarboni\\ns\\ned and stable source of en\\nergy.\\n \\nNew targets for renewables, but several barriers might hinder their deployment\\n \\nJapan and Korea have both updated their renewable\\ns\\n \\n(incl. hydro) penetration \\ntargets. The Japanese draft 6\\nth\\n \\nSEP \\nrevealed\\n \\nthat renewables will account for 36\\n-\\n38% of power \\ngeneration by 2030, which is a substantial increase from its previously \\nstated target (i.e. 22\\n-\\n24% by 2030 in the 5\\nth\\n \\nSEP adopted in 2018).  South Korea has, \\nhowever, set an objective for renewables to reach 30% of installed power capacity \\n(the previous pl\\n\\ntarget \\nsolar and \\nwind capacities\\n \\nas \\nrepresent\\ning\\n \\nthe bulk of the planned power generation capacities \\nto be deployed in the coming years.  \\n \\nMeeting these aggressive targets \\nwill\\n \\nnot \\nbe \\nan easy task for the \\ntwo countries. They \\nboth experience high renewables costs, which are mainly underpinned by issues \\n \\n83\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nrelated to \\nthe \\navailability of land\\n,\\n \\nadministrative hurdles (e.g. permit processes\\n,\\n \\nlocal \\nacceptance) and other \\nstructural \\nmarket barriers that prevent compet\\nition and access \\nto power networks for renewable projects developers. Japan has advanced its power \\nmarket reforms to mitigate these constraints (e.g. \\nits \\nConnect and Manage policy), \\nbut still needs to improve the flexibility of its power system and invest \\nmassively in \\nits \\ninfrastructure to overcome the existing grid bottlenecks. \\n \\nSouth Korea, which still has a low \\npenetration of \\nrenewables\\n \\ncompared to other \\nOECD countries, \\nis \\nstriv\\ning\\n \\nto accelerate its renewables deployment, particularly \\nthrough instating r\\nenewable portfolio standards. The latter obligates energy \\nproducers to include a share of renewables in their portfolio. In April 2021, the \\ngovernment raised the RPS share from 10% to 25% to support its commitment\\n \\nto \\nclean energy\\n. \\n \\nThe integration of \\na \\nlar\\nge share of renewables is a key concern for both Japan and \\nKorea. Although the two countries will scale up the deployment of flexibility options \\n(e.g. back\\n-\\nup capacities\\n,\\n \\ndemand\\n-\\nside management and storage options), their \\naggressive targets are likely to \\ncreate\\n \\nsignificant challenges \\nfor\\n \\nthe stability of \\nnetworks and might hinder \\nthe \\naccelerated progress of intermittent renewables. \\nMoreover, the aggressive deployment might \\nput\\n \\nfurther pressure on the cost of \\nelectricity charged to residential and business \\nend\\n-\\nusers, \\nnegatively \\naffecting the \\nenergy affordability and competitiveness of business activities \\n \\nThe GGO assumes that Japan and Korea are not on track to achieve their \\nrenewables penetration targets, despite the significant progress \\nthat \\nwill be achiev\\ned. \\nThe various economic and technical challenges\\n, in particular\\n \\nrenewables integration\\n,\\n \\nwill weigh on renewables development in the two countries. \\n \\nUnited States\\n \\nBiden presidency: \\nr\\neshaping energy and climate policies to support \\nthe \\nlow\\n-\\ncarbon transition \\n \\nThe US has unveiled a new NDC plan, reiterating the Obama\\n-\\nera target to reduce \\nemissions by 26\\n-\\n28% in 2025 compared to 2005, and including a new target to \\nachieve \\na \\n50\\n-\\n52% reduction by 2030\\n \\n(33)\\n. These announcements at the Earth Day \\nSummit held on April 2\\n\\nthe pre\\nvious President \\n\\nrestrictions. \\n \\nSince the \\nbeginning\\n \\nof his presidential mandate, \\nPresident \\nBiden has taken several \\nearly \\ndecisions that confi\\nrm this new direction including \\nthe joining of the Paris \\nAgreement; instating a moratorium on \\nnew \\noil and gas developments on federal lands \\nand waters, artic and national monuments; pausing for review various regulations \\nunder the energ\\ny dominance policy (e.g. facilitations for energy infrastructure \\n \\n84\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nbuildings; relaxed methane rules and other regulations to remove impediments on \\nenergy production). \\n \\nThe \\nn\\new administration\\n\\n \\nenergy policy is expected to be driven by the various \\norientation\\ns declared by Biden during his election campaign.

Furthermore, it \\nhas \\nannounced significant support to \\nrenewables f\\nor power generation that might affect gas consumption in this sector. \\n \\nDespite these restrictive policies for gas, this fuel still has a role to play in the US\\n,\\n \\ngiven its numerous economic and environmental advantages. For the economic \\naspects, gas is a so\\nurce of substantial revenues for the American economy and the \\noil and gas producing states in particular. In this context, \\nseveral voices and opposing \\nforces have been raised at state and business levels \\nto lift the drilling moratorium on \\nfederal lands and\\n \\navoid \\nan \\naggressive shrinkage of production and tax revenues. The \\nUS court in the western district of Louisiana \\nhas ordered to end the moratorium which \\nwill cause \\nsignificant financial difficulties \\nto several states\\n \\n(35)\\n. \\nIn the meantime, the \\nUS administr\\nation approved \\nmore than 3000 \\noil and gas \\ndrilling permits\\n \\nand offered \\nnew leases for oil and gas companies, specifically in the Gulf of Mexico\\n. \\nThis \\nexemplifies the importance of hydrocarbons in the US economy\\n, both at federal and \\nstate levels\\n. \\n \\nNevertheless, i\\nt is worth mentioning that the US gas industry is responding to the \\nclimate challenge, through scaling up options that support deep decarboni\\ns\\nation of \\nnatural gas, including through \\nthe \\ndeployment of CCS and offsetting mechanisms.  \\nCCS has a\\n \\nhuge potential in the country underpinned by the availability of technical \\nskills, innovation dynamics and the existence of significant \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nstorage capacities in \\nmature fields.  CCS has recently got a push from \\nC\\nongress, with a regulation proposal \\n \\n85\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nthat gr\\nants tax credits and support to this technology. In addition to its economic \\nbenefits, natural gas \\nis proven\\n \\nto have significant environmental advantages \\nand \\nmakes a \\nlarge contribution to reducing US carbon emissions, specifically through \\ncoal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switc\\nhing in the power sector.  \\n \\nThe GGO \\ntakes into account\\n \\nthe implementation of gas policy restrictions, which will \\ncontribute to a downward revision of gas demand and domestic supply compared to \\nthe last GGO edition. Nevertheless, natural gas is assumed to k\\neep a considerable \\nrole in power generation, including through CCS abatement, and heating services. \\nGas utilisation in the transport sector, especially LNG for heavy vehicles, will benefit \\nfrom strengthened emissions standards.  \\n \\nRenewables: significant pu\\nsh to support carbon\\n-\\nfree power generation target, \\nbut progress \\nis\\n \\nchallenged by the need to balance reliability \\nand \\nintermittency\\n \\nThe new US administration considers renewables expansion as a critical driver to \\nsupport the announced carbon\\n-\\nfree objective \\nfor power generation. In this regard, the \\nupdated US NDC outlined various policy instruments and guiding lines for renewables \\npromotion, including i) strengthening incentives and standards to reduce pollution; ii) \\ncoordinating with state and local governme\\nnts to encourage \\nthe \\nrapid deployment of \\nrenewables; iii) reinforcing transmission and storage capacities. \\n \\nFurthermore, \\nthe\\n \\nBiden administration has proposed to extend investment and \\nproduction tax credits (ITC and PTC) for \\nten \\nyears for solar and wind pr\\nojects\\n \\n(36)\\n. \\nThe federal government grants special attention to offshore wind, \\naimed at \\ninstall\\ning\\n \\n30 GW capacity by 2030 and 110 GW by 2050. It also considers tax incentives for \\nenergy storage, batteries and long\\n-\\ndistance transmission lines. \\nIn August \\n2021, t\\nhe \\nUS \\nS\\nenate adopted a \\nUSD \\n1 trillion infrastructure plan, as part of the 3PB Biden \\nproposal, focusing on clean and renewables technologies. This plan constitutes a \\nsignificant push for renewables, although the allocated funds have been more than \\nha\\nlved compared to the initial proposals.  \\n \\nDespite this federal support, the major driver of renewables expansion remains the \\nstate\\n-\\nlevel programs and supports. These particularly include the implementation of \\nthe Renewables Portfolio Standards (RPS), which\\n \\nhave been enforced in thirty states. \\nOther states have established voluntary renewables targets. The RPS scheme \\ndefines renewables obligations for power producers. Twelve states (\\nincluding \\nCalifornia\\n,\\n \\nColorado, Maine and New Mexico) have a mandate to reac\\nh 100% \\nrenewables by 2050 or earlier. The state\\n-\\nlevel support adds to the effort of cities and \\ncompanies to scale up the\\nir\\n \\nuptake of clean energy. Several companies have \\ncommitted themselves to procure 100% renewables through the RE100 initiative. \\nOther co\\nmpanies\\n,\\n \\nincluding major oil and gas producers\\n,\\n \\nhave set net\\n-\\nzero emissions \\ntarget\\ns\\n, directing more efforts towards renewables development.  \\n \\n \\n86\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nThe GGO assumes the implementation of strengthened renewables policy support, \\nwhich will drive substantial progres\\ns. Nevertheless, the country is not on track to meet \\nthe carbon\\n-\\nfree power target, mainly due to economic challenges (e.g. cost of \\nelectricity); regional disparities as well as the difficulties \\nof\\n \\nintegrat\\ning\\n \\nintermittent \\nrenewables and secure power in pea\\nk demand periods. The recurrence of power \\noutages (e.g. Texas, California) and energy conservation notices\\n \\nreveal\\n \\nthe \\ndifficulties \\nof maintaining the\\n \\nstability and security of \\nthe \\npower supply with a power \\ngrid relying \\nheavily \\non intermittent renewables. C\\nalifornia \\nhas \\nundert\\naken\\n \\nsome steps \\nto allow more gas\\n-\\nfired power plants \\nto operate\\n \\nas a flexible option for power \\ngeneration.  \\n \\nElectrification and \\nh\\nydrogen: strengthened commitments to scale up these \\noptions.\\n \\nElectrification \\nhas \\nbenefit\\ned\\n \\nfrom a signific\\nant push with various announcements \\nincluding a commitment to achieve 50% EVs of the total new \\nvehicle \\nsales\\n,\\n \\nnew \\nstringent emissions standards to be applied from 2023 on light\\n-\\nduty vehicles\\n \\nand\\n \\nthe \\nadoption of federal funding supports for the development of charging infrastructure \\nand electrifi\\ncation of the\\n \\npublic transportation system. Furthermore, the \\nadministration is considering various supportive measures for electrifying buildings \\nincludin\\ng through a larger deployment of electric heat pumps. \\n \\nHydrogen has also \\nreceived \\nincreasing attention in the country. The DOE published, \\nby the end of 2020, a Hydrogen \\nP\\nrogram plan, which states some key priorities for \\nthe country\\n \\n(37)\\n. They include incre\\nasing hydrogen production capacity (estimated at \\n10 \\nmn.\\n \\ntons\\n \\nin 2018) by two to four times in 2050; reducing the cost of green hydrogen \\nby two to three times; leveraging the hydrocarbon potential and availability of gas \\ninfrastructures to support capacity \\ndevelopments. The plan outlined a potential to \\nscale\\n-\\nup hydrogen in sectors like steel\\n,\\n \\ndata centr\\ne\\ns\\n,\\n \\nshipping and heavy\\n-\\nduty \\ntransport vehicles. It focuses on research and innovation to support the identified \\npriorities and overcome technical and economic\\n \\nbarriers, specifically through the \\n\\nsuch as\\n \\nCalifornia are significantly stepping into the hydrogen economy with aggressive plans \\nto boost demand, including in the transport\\n \\nsector\\n. Californ\\nia considers hydrogen as \\na key solution to balance renewables intermittency. \\n \\nThe GGO factors in strengthened eff\\niciency and emissions standards and \\nlarger \\nfinancial support\\n \\nthat incentivize electrification, particularly in the transport sector. \\nNeverthele\\nss, the US is assumed not \\nto be \\non track to reach an EVs share of 50% in \\nits new sales. For hydrogen, the GGO assumes larger support for hydrogen will drive \\nthe US to triple its current production, and that the larger share will be produced from \\nhydrocarbo\\nn sources, including blue hydrogen.  \\n \\n \\n87\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nLatin American Countries\\n \\nStrengthened momentum to enhance climate ambition in the region, but Brazil \\nand Mexico mark an exception by submitting weaker NDCs. \\n \\nMost Latin American countries have enhanced their climate targets in their \\nrecently \\nupdated NDCs, marking their commitment to strengthen\\ning\\n \\nefforts to reduce their \\nGHGs emissions. There are two key exceptions to this enhanced momentum, namely \\nBrazil and Me\\nxico. The two countries \\nhave \\npledged to keep the same mitigation \\ntargets for 2030\\n \\nwhich they\\n \\nposted in their previous NDCs (i.e. 43% compared to \\n2005 for Brazil and 22% compared to a baseline scenario for Mexico). \\nAt\\n \\nthe same \\ntime, they \\nhave \\nrevised \\nboth \\nt\\nhe base year and baseline scenario used for their \\nestimations. \\nAs a result of t\\nhese revisions\\n, \\nemissions levels \\nwill \\nnot reflect an \\nenhanced ambition compared to what \\nw\\nas estimated in the first NDCs (38)\\n.\\n \\nBy comparison, \\nother Latin American countries\\n \\n(\\nArge\\nntina, Chile and Columbia\\n)\\n \\nhave \\nundert\\naken\\n \\nconsiderable revisions. Argentina pledged to reach almost 360 Mt\\nCO\\n2\\n \\nof \\nits GHGs emissions by 2030, which is equivalent to \\nan almost \\n26% reduction \\ncompared to the first NDC (submitted in 2016). \\nIn addition, t\\nhe pre\\nsident of Argentina \\nannounced \\na \\n\\nclimate \\nsummit organized by the US in April 2021. \\n \\nChile shifted its GHG intensity target into an absolute target (i.e. 95 Mt\\nCO\\n2\\n \\nof GHGs \\nemissions by 2030). This emi\\nssion target is much more ambitious than the \\namount\\n \\nof emissions \\nwhich would have \\nresult\\ned\\n \\nfrom the first NDC. Chile \\nhas \\nalso pledged \\nto peak \\nits \\nemissions by 2025. Colombia \\nhas \\ncommitted to reduc\\ning\\n \\nits 2030 \\nemissions by 51% compared \\nto \\na baseline scenari\\no, marking a large increase from \\nits previous 20% reduction target. One key feature \\ncommon to\\n \\nLatin American \\ncountries relates to the weight of the \\nl\\nand\\n-\\nuse sector in their emissions. A non\\n-\\n\\nl\\nand\\n-\\nuse \\neffect, including more preservation of forests. \\n \\nBesides the updated NDCs\\n, \\nan \\nincreasing number of Latin American countries have \\nun\\nveiled their ambition to achieve net\\n-\\nzero emissions. Uruguay \\nhas said it plans \\nto \\nmeet this objective by 2030, while other countries like Costa Rica, Chile, Columbia \\nand Argentina \\nhave \\nset \\na \\ncarbon neutrality target by 2050. \\nIn April 2021, \\nColombia \\nrelease\\nd a long\\n-\\nterm strategy to achieve this goal, while Chile is discussing the \\npossibility \\nof\\n \\nenforc\\ning\\n \\nthis goal into its climate law. \\n \\nAlthough Brazil has posted \\na \\nless ambitious NDC for the 2030 horizon, it revealed \\nenhanced climate ambition over the longer\\n \\nterm. The \\nBrazilian President Bolsonaro \\nhas \\ndeclared a new ambition to meet net\\n-\\nzero by 2050, following a previous \\nannouncement by his administration to reach this goal by 2060, with the condition of \\navailability of international financial support\\n \\n(39)\\n. \\n \\n \\n88\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nRecent policies confirm significant support to natural gas amid growing power \\ngeneration \\nrequirements \\nand lack of hydropower availability\\n \\nSeveral Latin American countries experienced record drought\\ns\\n \\nin 2020, putting large \\npressure on hydropower availability. This situation has reinforced policy momentum \\nto support gas\\n-\\nfired power plants as a way to compensate for hydropower fluctuations \\nand meet the growing power generation needs. \\nThe u\\nse of n\\natural \\ngas is also \\nbeing \\nincentivized as a clean source in the industry and transport \\nsectors \\nand \\nan \\nappropriate enabler for intermittent renewables development. \\n \\nGas\\n-\\nsupportive policies involve both the supply and demand sides\\n \\nof the equation\\n. \\nOn the supply side\\n, countries in Latin America\\n \\nare striving\\n \\nto diversify their sources, \\nincluding both domestic production and imports. They \\nhave \\nalso deployed significant \\nefforts to overcome the challenges and difficulties brought \\nabout \\nby COVID\\n-\\n19 on the \\ngas industry. Mex\\nico has taken some steps, notably through accelerated permitting, \\nto facilitate LNG imports and \\nthe building of \\nstorage capacity amid the recent \\nconcerns about pipeline availability from the US (due to the \\nfreeze on imports from \\nTexas). The government \\nhas \\nunveiled its intention to revive the storage policy, \\naiming \\nto encourage \\ntenders for project development and \\nto \\nuse depleted gas fields as \\nstorage sites. Furthermore, Mexico \\nis \\ncontinu\\ning\\n \\nto grant economic and financial \\nadvantages to the national company P\\nEMEX to support its recovery after the COVID\\n-\\n19 outbreak. \\n \\nBrazil achieved a milestone step with the adoption of its gas liberalization law. \\nThis\\n \\naims to increase competition for the development of gas supply chains and lower gas \\nprices for domestic custom\\ners\\n \\n(40)\\n. The country \\nis \\nstriv\\ning\\n \\nto reinforce its \\nrelationships with \\nneighboring\\n \\npipeline exporters, namely Bolivia and Argentina. The \\nlatter \\nhas \\nresumed gas exports to Brazil after \\na \\nsix\\n-\\nyear\\n \\nhiatus\\n. \\n \\nArgentina \\nis \\npursu\\ning\\n \\nthe implementation of its gas incentive plan (GAS PLAN 4), \\na \\nkey element of which is to \\nset a floor price for domestic producers which \\nis\\n \\nhigher \\nthan local market prices. The government \\nalso \\nannounced in May 2021 further \\nreforms and incentives to accelera\\nte domestic oil and gas production, including from \\nthe Vacca \\nMuerta shale field, to support both domestic production and exports. \\nTrinidad & Tobago has launched a reform process to relax drilling terms, attract \\ninvestors and accelerate licensing for gas ex\\nploration and development, including in \\ndeep offshore areas. \\n \\nMoreover, Suriname and Guyana have recently announced developing a joint gas \\nstrategy aimed at leveraging partnership to develop infrastructures and boost gas \\ndevelopments. The recent discoverie\\ns confirmed large resources potential and raised \\nthe \\ninterest of foreign companies in the region. \\n \\n \\nOn the gas demand side, the main recent measures include the intensification of \\nauctioning for both developing new gas\\n-\\nfired power plants and supplying comp\\netitive \\n \\n89\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ngas to existing plants in Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Chile \\nis \\nalso consider\\ning\\n \\nrepurposing a part of its coal power fleet into gas and developing \\ng\\nas \\nc\\nombined cycle\\n \\npower plants\\n, specifically in \\nthe\\n \\ncontext of lower hydropower availability. Chil\\ne \\nhas \\npledged to completely phase out coal by 2040. Colombia\\n\\n \\nenergy policy also \\nsupport\\ns\\n \\na\\n \\nlarger role for natural gas, particularly for power generation and residential \\nsectors. The \\n\\nten \\nmilestones\\n\\n \\npolicy communicated by the \\nM\\ninistry of \\nE\\nnergy aims to \\nadvance access to gas for households as part of the national development plan \\nobjective which aims to reach more than 10 million natural gas users\\n \\n(41)\\n. \\nFurthermore, the government supports gas\\n-\\nfired power plants as part of its \\nannounced ambition to cut co\\nal\\n-\\nbased emissions and comply with hydropower \\nfluctuations. \\n \\nThe GGO assumes the implementation of gas supportive policies in most Latin \\nAmerican countries, targeting particularly the power generation sector, and to \\na \\nless\\ner\\n \\nextent\\n,\\n \\nindustry and transport.\\n \\nNevertheless, the GGO considers an increasing \\ncontribution of gas\\n-\\nfired power plants for meeting peak\\n-\\nload regimes and \\ncomplementing hydro and renewables. This will limit the utilisation rates of gas\\n-\\nfired \\ncapacities and weigh on the growth potential of g\\nas demand for power over the \\nlong\\n \\nterm\\n.\\n \\nRenewables:  policy push is driven by auctioning and revised emissions \\ntargets, but several challenges affect renewables progress\\n \\n \\nAuctioning of renewables projects, including particularly solar and wind, continues to \\nbe the key policy instrument in the region to drive renewables expansion and \\nascertain\\n \\ntheir prices. Auctioning has contributed to increase\\nd\\n \\ncompetition and\\n \\nhas\\n \\nimprove\\nd\\n \\nthe economics of renewables projects, which have \\nseen\\n \\na substantial cost \\ndecrease over the last five years.  \\n \\nAlthough COVID\\n-\\n19 \\nhas \\nhad a severe impact on economic conditions in Latin \\nAmerica and \\nresulted in\\n \\na postponement of renewables auctions in 2020, \\nthere are \\nsome signs of resurgence in 2021. Brazil awarded almost 1 GW \\nof \\nrenewable projects \\ncapacity under an auction held in July 2021 and plans a new auctioning round in \\nSeptember, with more than 60 GW of registered projects to support its announced \\ntar\\nget in the PDE 2030 plan (i.e. \\na \\n48% renewables share by 2030). Colombia and \\nChile \\nhave \\nannounced auctioning rounds, associated with \\nthe \\nPower Purchase \\nAgreement (PPA), to be conducted by the end of the year. Argentina \\nhas \\nunveiled \\na \\nstrengthened ambition \\nto scale up renewables projects, including particularly wind \\nand distributed solar in rural areas. Auctions are key instruments to support the \\ncountry\\n\\n \\nambition, particularly those held within the framework of the RENOVAR \\nprogram and Renewable Energies in\\n \\nRural Markets initiative (PEMVER)\\n.\\n \\nThe upward\\ns\\n \\nrevision of emission targets in the NDCs and \\nl\\nong\\n-\\nterm strategies \\nrecently released by different countries, constitute an important driver for \\n \\n90\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nstrengthening renewables goals and policies. Chile has already po\\nsted targets to \\ngenerate respectively 50% and 70% of its electricity from renewables (incl. \\nhydropower) by 2035 and 2050. Columbia \\nhas \\nannounced a goal to reach 4 GW \\nrenewables capacity by 2030. It plans to install 1.5 GW of intermittent renewables \\n(specifically solar and wind) by 2022.  The Latin American countries have also made \\na collective pledge to meet 70% of their power generation from renewable sources \\n(including hydropower)\\n.\\n \\n \\nBiofuels attract significant policy attention in the region given \\nthe huge available \\npotential and their role in local activities and development. Several countries have \\nalready enacted policies encouraging biofuel blending\\n:\\n \\nBrazil, Argentina, Colombia \\nand Peru\\n \\nhave\\n \\nimplement\\ned\\n \\nbiofuels blending mandates, which require b\\nlending \\nethanol with gasoline and biodiesel with diesel. R\\na\\nising these mandates\\n, however,\\n \\nremains a key uncertainty due to inflationary pressure and the risk of deforestation. \\nIn this context, it is worth noting that Brazil increased its mandate \\nby \\na \\nlower\\n \\nrate \\nthan \\nthe targeted trajectory, while Argentina reduced \\nits\\n \\nmandate from 10% to 5% in July \\n2021. \\n \\nThe GGO factors in strengthened renewables support schemes including intensified \\nauctioning and support to distributed solutions (e.g. net metering scheme\\ns\\n \\nfor rooftop \\nsolar). The implementation of carbon pricing\\n, for example\\n \\nin Mexico and Argentina\\n,\\n \\nis assumed to play in favo\\nu\\nr of renewables progress. However, the GGO assumes \\nthat countries are still not on track to meet their announced targets due to vari\\nous \\nchallenges. These include financing issues\\n,\\n \\nregulatory barriers (e.g. Mexico)\\n,\\n \\npolitical \\nuncertainties\\n,\\n \\naccess to the grid and lack of reinforced power networks\\n,\\n \\nlack of \\nhydropower availability and the difficulties \\nof\\n \\nrais\\ning\\n \\nbiofuels\\n \\nproduction\\n \\namid \\nc\\nompetition for land. \\n \\nAfrica\\nn\\n \\na\\nnd \\nt\\nhe Middle East\\nern\\n \\nCountries\\n \\nC\\nlimate ambition: \\nstrengthened NDCs commitments\\n, but actions remain \\nchallenged by requirements for economic and social \\ndevelopment\\n \\nSeveral countries in the Middle East and Africa have embraced \\nthe global momentum \\nof enhancing climate ambition, notably through the upward revision of their NDCs \\ntargets. In Africa, South Africa has stated a target to keep emissions within a 350\\n-\\n420 MtCO\\n2\\n \\nrange, marking a significant reduction compared to its previo\\nus NDC\\n \\n(42)\\n. \\nNigeria has strengthened its conditional GHGs reduction goal from 45% to 47% by \\n2030, while Angola has submitted its first NDC after the ratification of the Paris \\nAgreement in November 2020, intending to reduce emissions by 14% in 2025 \\ncompare\\nd to a base case pathway. In the Middle East, Qatar and the UAE have \\nannounced new GHGs mitigation targets, aiming at reducing their 2030 emissions by \\n25% and 23.5% respectively, compared to a baseline scenario. The UAE \\nwas t\\nhe \\n \\n91\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nfirst country in the Middle \\nEast to declare \\na \\ncarbo\\nn neutrality objective by 2050, \\nfollowed by Saudi Arabia posting a target to be carbon neutral by 2060. \\n \\nIn addition to NDCs revisions, some African countries (e.g. Senegal, Angola and \\nSouth Africa) are considering net\\n-\\nzero emissions\\n \\ntargets, mainly through their \\nengagement in the Climate Ambition Alliance (CAA), which is a\\nn\\n \\nUN\\n-\\nbacked initiative \\n\\nachiev\\ne\\n \\nnet\\n-\\nzero emissions by 2050\\n). \\nSouth \\nAfrica has \\nalready \\ncommunicated a low\\n-\\nemission strategy stating a vision to become \\ncarbon neutral by 2050.  \\n \\nThe more stringent climate pledges in the Middle East and Africa are challenged by \\nthe imperatives of economic development and social progress. Access to affordable \\nand reliable energy \\nis a key concern, particularly in Sub\\n-\\nSaharan African countries. \\nThese countries still contain around 570 million people with no access to electricity, \\nand 80% of the energy consumed for cooking is mainly from wood and charcoal, used \\nin non\\n-\\nsustainable con\\nditions. Hydrocarbons might therefore still have central role to \\nplay in improving energy access in this region. For the hydrocarbon\\n-\\nexporting \\ncountries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, the uncertainty over future \\ninternational hydrocarbo\\nn demand and the volatility of export revenues will affect their \\nfinancial resources and capability to implement strengthened climate actions. \\n \\nOverall, despite the increased climate awareness and intention to reduce the carbon \\nfootprint, financial support\\n \\nand technology transfer will be critical in translating \\ncommitments into concrete actions and to support countries in building diversified \\nand resilient economies. \\n \\nNatural gas: policy push to develop domestic capacities and increase gas \\npenetration  \\n \\nAfr\\nica and the Middle East have almost 50% of the proved gas \\nreserves in the world \\nwith a significant resource potential that can still be tapped, specifically in the under\\n-\\nexplored African areas. Recent developments show an increasing policy effort to \\nencour\\nage investment in developing upstream capacities and gas infrastructures, \\nparticularly in countries endowed with gas resources. Algeria and Nigeria have \\nrecently adopted new hydrocarbon laws that aim to incentivize investments in this \\nsector. Algeria has a\\nnnounced a substantial increase in the investment effort to renew \\nits reserve basis\\n \\n(43)\\n, while Qatar is pursuing an aggressive plan to reinforce its \\nproduction and export capacities, with a target to reach 126 mt LNG exports per year \\nby 2027. Egypt is imp\\nlementing reforms aimed at encouraging competition and the \\nopening of its gas sector, and it has also accelerated the bidding rounds for gas \\nexploration and development, specifically in deep waters and western areas.                                        \\n                          \\n \\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE are pushing their plans to develop gas production \\ncapacities to feed power generation and export\\n-\\noriented industries. The two countries \\nplan to allocate considerable gas volumes for their hydrogen and amm\\nonia \\n \\n92\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\ndevelopments as they envision becoming leading exporters in these fields. Other \\ncountries with less gas potential, like Ghana and South Africa, are increasing their \\neffort to tap this potential including through intensification of bidding rounds. \\n \\nOn \\nthe demand side, countries in the Middle East and Africa continue to promote gas \\nas a key fuel for meeting growing baseload power generation (e.g. Nigeria), \\nsubstituting oil products (e.g. Saudi Arabia), encouraging industrial developments \\n(e.g. Algeria, E\\ngypt, Qatar), monetizing associated and flared gas (e.g. Nigeria; Iraq) \\nor substituting for coal (e.g. South Africa). Other countries, like Mozambique, \\nTanzania and Senegal, are actively promoting natural gas in order to leverage recent \\ngas discoveries. Na\\ntural gas is also being encouraged in the transport sector in some \\ncountries such as Nigeria and Egypt through incentivizing vehicle conversions and \\nbuilding gas refueling stations.\\n \\nDespite these gas\\n-\\nsupportive policies, several challenges might affect the\\n \\nprogress \\nof natural gas in Africa and the Middle East. These include the restrictions on funding \\ngas infrastructures from some banks and financial institutions, the lack of capabilities \\nand access to technologies, political and regulatory issues affecting\\n \\nattractiveness in \\nvarious countries and the volatility of international gas prices that constrain \\ninvestments. To overcome these challenges, some regional initiatives have been \\nlaunched, notably in Africa, such as the regional gas master plan for southern\\n \\nAfrican \\ncountries backed by the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA), the African \\nEnergy Chamber initiative for gas trade and investment and the LNG to Africa \\ninitiative aiming at strengthening LNG exchanges and encouraging small\\n-\\nscale LNG \\noptions\\n \\n(\\n44)(45)\\n. \\n \\nThe GGO supposes that natural gas will benefit from a policy push in the Middle East \\nand Africa, specifically through measures that encourage investment and \\ninfrastructure development. The two regions will substantially increase the domestic \\nprod\\nuction that will enable them to satisfy national demand and exports. Penetration \\nof natural gas will grow but will be increasingly challenged by the anticipated \\nexpansion of renewables, solar in particular. \\n \\n2.\\n3\\n \\nEnergy\\n-\\nrelated \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nemissions \\nprospects\\n \\nEmissions on a global scale\\n \\nAfter a strong post\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 rebound in 2021 (almost 4% growth compared to \\n2020), the f\\nuture energy\\n-\\nrelated \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nemissions are expected to \\ngrow in 2022 by \\n1.6%, before plateauing and peaking by 2024 at around 34.6 GtCO\\n2\\n. After th\\nis date, \\nemissions will observe a significant decline to reach nearly 29.5 GtCO\\n2\\n \\nby 2050.\\n \\nThe emissions increase in 2021\\n \\nis not only being driven by the recovery of economic \\nactivity in several regions, but also by the increased use of energy\\n-\\nintensive \\nhyd\\nrocarbons, particularly coal. Indeed, the substantial growth of energy prices and \\n \\n93\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ntensions on power generation outputs give some push to coal, specifically in Asia\\n \\n(46)\\n. It is estimated that coal\\n-\\nrel\\nated emissions represent around\\n.40% of the \\nanticipated ad\\nditional emissions between 2020 and 2021. \\n \\nOver the longer\\n \\nterm, the implementation of strengthened policy actions contributes \\nto driving the decline in emissions by 2050 by more than 3.2 GtCO\\n2\\n \\ncompared to the \\n2020 level (Figure 2.1). Although this pathway\\n \\nmarks a substantial downward revision \\ncompared to the previous GGO outlook forecasts, it remains far above the trajectory \\nneeded to comply with the Paris Agreement objectives (i.e. keeping temperature \\nincreases to well below 2\\n°\\nC\\n \\nby the end of the century)\\n. In 2050, the gap between the \\nenergy\\n-\\nrelated CO\\n2\\n \\nemissions in the reference case and the 2\\n°\\nC\\n \\ntrajectory is \\nestimated at between 13.5 and 21.5 GtCO\\n2\\n, depending on the role of various \\nmitigation options including the deployment of carbon removal options and\\n \\nnature\\n-\\nbased solutions (the gap is estimated based on the contribution of energy\\n-\\nrelated \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nemissions in the global GHGs).

This effort needs\\n \\nto go beyond the most recent NDCs pledges \\nsubmitted for COP 26 (1)(47). Indeed, as highlighted in Figure 2.1, the \\nimplementation of these updated NDCs is estimated to reduce the energy\\n-\\nrelated \\nCO2 emissions gap by around 2.7 GtCO2 in 2030 (average in the \\nmin\\n-\\nmax range of \\n2.2\\n-\\n3.2 GtCO2) compared to the reference case. This will diminish the 2030 \\nemissions from 33.2 to around 30.8 GtCO2. \\n \\nNatural gas is capable of playing a critical role in diminishing this emissions gap, \\nthrough larger penetration against c\\noal and oil. Together, coal and oil are still forecast \\nto account for two\\n-\\nthirds of the global energy\\n-\\nrelated emissions by 2050. Coal, in \\nparticular, is expected to be responsible for 31% of these emissions, although it will \\nrepresent 21% of the primary en\\nergy demand by 2050. These shares compare with \\n\\nshare) and emit 35% (4 percentage points higher than coal) of 2050 emissions \\nglobally. \\n \\nOn average, the carbon intensity of n\\natural gas is estimated at around 2 tCO\\n2\\n/toe, \\nnearly half the intensity of coal and 20% the intensity of oil. This gives the fuel the \\npossibility of achieving immediate and cost\\n-\\nefficient emission reductions through \\ndirect substitution, notably in power ge\\nneration, industry and transport sectors. \\nFurther deep decarbonisation of gas production and utilisation is possible, particularly \\nthrough scaling up CCS/CCUS and gas\\n-\\nbased hydrogen conversion. The \\ndecarbonisation of gas enables further reduction of its ca\\nrbon intensity and increase\\ns\\n \\nits credentials as a key contributor in supporting the Paris\\n-\\naligned pathways. \\n \\nE\\nmissions by regions and sectors\\n \\nDespite the anticipated decline of energy\\n-\\nrelated CO\\n2\\n \\nemissions at \\nthe \\nglobal level, \\nthe future prospects of \\nemissions at a regional level exhibit differentiated trajectories. \\nAfrica, the Middle East and Latin America are set to increase their emissions \\nsubstantially, even when compared to the pre\\n-\\nCOVID level in 2019. Together, they \\nare forecast to add around 1.3\\n \\nGtCO\\n2\\n \\nin 2050 com\\npared to 2019 (a 27% increase). \\nAfrica will observe the highest emissions progression, followed by Latin America, with \\nannual growth rates estimated respectively at around 1.2% and 0.8% over the 2019\\n-\\n2050 period. Growth in the two regions\\n \\nwill be driven by the progress of economies \\nand populations as well as by an increased access to natural gas and oil to replace \\ntraditional usage of biomass and to deal with hydropower fluctuations. Emissions are \\nalso expected to grow in the Middle East. \\nNevertheless, the pace of progress in this \\nregion will be slower than in \\nAfrica and Latin America\\n, since the expansion of solar \\npower, efficiency improvements and nuclear (e.g. the UAE) will contribute to reducing \\nemissions growth.\\n \\n \\n95\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFigure 2\\n.\\n2\\n.\\n \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nemissions forecasts by regions (left) and by sectors (right) (MtCO\\n2\\n)\\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from GECF GGM\\n \\n\\n-\\nrelated and transformation industries\\n \\nConversely, Europe and North America will pursue their steep emissions reductions, \\nwith an annual downward trajectory estimated at 2.5% and 1.1% respectively \\nbetween 2019 and 2050.

These forecasts are underpinned by the efforts of the EU and \\nalso the UK to support their deep decarbonisation pledges North America will also \\naccelerate its emissions decline after the dramatic reversal in US policy under the \\nnew Biden administration.  \\n \\n \\nAsia Pacific is expected to cap its emissions \\nby 2024\\n \\nbefore observing a decrease \\nthrough \\n2050. \\nOECD Asia (including Japan and Korea) together with China will be \\nthe key driver of this reduction.

Further efforts are needed to reduce coal (which is still expected to represent \\n23% of the primary energy mix by 2050) and promote deep dec\\narbonisation options \\nincluding CCUS and hydrogen. Hydrogen demand is forecast to reach around 190 \\nMtoe (66 mt) by 2050. The fuel has further expansion potential, either through \\nconversion from renewable sources or natural gas, leveraging on the expected \\nex\\npansion of renewables and gas assets in the country. \\n \\nIndia\\n \\nIndia is also well on track to meet its NDC target aimed at reducing \\nthe GHG intensity \\nof its GDP by 33\\n-\\n35%\\n \\nin 2030.

De\\nspite the huge progress of \\nrenewables, efficiency improvements and the expansion of natural gas, the dominant \\nrole of affordable coal in the country will hamper future emissions reduction \\nprospects. Coal will account for 41% of the primary energy mix by 20\\n50, and will be \\nresponsible for 70% of energy\\n-\\nrelated emissions in India. The transition towards a \\ngas\\n-\\nbased economy through larger coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas substitution will be instrumental in \\ndriving down Indian emissions. \\n \\nEuropean Union\\n \\nThe implementation of \\nstrengthened policy measures in the framework of the Green \\nDeal agenda will support the decline of energy\\n-\\nrelated emissions in the EU.  \\nNevertheless, the region will not achieve its targets to reduce emissions by 55% in \\n2030 and will also not reach carbon \\nneutrality by 2050. EU emissions will peak at 2.4 \\nGtCO\\n2\\n \\nin 2030, almost 25% higher than the energy\\n-\\nrelated emissions which would \\nallow the 55% target to be met. \\n \\nThe anticipated mismatch with the EU climate targets is underpinned by insufficient \\nprogress i\\nn the deployment of various mitigation options (e.g. renewables) compared \\n\\nenhanced collective targets for renewables, efficiency, hydrogen and EVs penetration \\nare expected to\\n \\nbe missed by some margin, due to a combination of technical and \\neconomic challenges as well as the disparity between MS efforts and capabilities. \\n \\n\\n-\\nterm CO\\n2\\n \\nemissions are also not in line with \\ntrajectories \\nwhich are \\naligned\\n \\nwith \\nthe 2050 carbon\\n-\\nneutral\\n \\nobjective. According to the long\\n-\\nterm \\nstrategy published in November 2018, GHG emissions need to be reduced by at least \\n80%, which requires energy\\n-\\nrelated \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nemissions to be less than \\n730\\n \\nMt\\nCO\\n2\\n. The \\nestimated gap between the antici\\npated \\nGHG\\n \\nemissions in 2050 and a carbon\\n-\\nneutral \\ncompatible trajectory is more than 0.\\n5\\n \\nGt\\nCO\\n2\\n. \\n \\nUnited States\\n \\nAfter a short\\n-\\nlived post COVID\\n-\\n19 resurgence, t\\nhe US is expected to \\nplateau its \\nemissions between 2023 and 2025, before observing a substantial de\\ncline through \\nto 2050. Despite a substantial downward revision compared to previous GGO \\nforecasts, reflecting the deep shift in US climate policy, it is estimated that US \\nemissions are still not in line with the announced targets. By 2030, emissions are \\nex\\npected to reach 4.2 GtCO\\n2\\n, which is nearly one\\n-\\nthird higher than emissions levels \\ncompatible with the posted target for this timeframe.\\n \\nThe decline of emissions is particularly supported by the decrease \\nin\\n \\noil and coal use, \\nand the strong expansion of rene\\nwables. The latter will drive the efforts to \\n \\n99\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ndecarbonise the power sector, but not to the extent targeted by the federal \\ngovernment. Indeed, the target to achieve free\\n-\\ncarbon power by 2035 will not be met. \\nIt is estimated that around two\\n-\\nthirds of the tota\\nl generated electricity in 2035 is \\nexpected to come from carbon\\n-\\nfree sources (i.e. renewables, hydro and nuclear) and \\nthree\\n-\\nquarters by 2050. \\n \\nThe US emissions pathway is still far from its 2050 carbon\\n-\\nneutral objective. There is \\na real need to scale up th\\ne various decarbonisation options, notably through \\ntechnolog\\nical\\n \\nprogress and adequate policy support. The potential of CCUS is huge \\nin the country, given the availability of technical capabilities, storage sites with oil and \\ngas depleted fields and large \\ngas assets\\n \\n(49)\\n. These synergies can be used to make \\nCCUS options competitive, especially when paired with CCGTs for electricity \\ngeneration. \\n \\nJapan\\n \\nThe GGO anticipates future energy\\n-\\nrelated \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nemissions to reach 870 Mt\\nCO\\n2\\n \\nin \\n2030, almost 15% lower than \\ntheir\\n \\n2020 level. Despite this emissions \\nshrinkage\\n, \\nJapan is anticipated to not be on track with its revised NDC target (i.e. 46% GHGs \\nreduction compared to 2013, which is equivalent to almost 670 Mt\\nCO\\n2\\n \\nof energy\\n-\\noriginated \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nemissions). \\n \\nThe decrease of\\n \\nemissions is notably driven by \\na\\n \\nreduction \\nin\\n \\ncoal and oil demand, \\nunderpinned by streng\\nt\\nh\\ne\\nned policies to restrict coal, push for renewables and \\nalternative transport vehicles.

With the arrival of the COVID\\n-\\n19 pandemic, enhanced decarbonisation \\ninitiatives and zero\\n-\\ncarbon pledges have come to the fore, and clean energy \\ninvestment promoting energy transition has received an additional impe\\ntus as a way \\nto the recovery and long\\n-\\nterm growth of devastated economies. In this context, \\nconsiderations for the rapid development of low\\n-\\ncarbon sources are taken into \\naccount. Simultaneously, the reference case scenario (RCS), which implies a more \\npragm\\natic and realistic approach, highlights the leading role of fossil fuels due to the \\nscale of their contribution to the current global energy mix and also their ability to \\nachieve long\\n-\\nterm goals to eliminate energy poverty and provide consumers with \\nreliab\\nle and affordable energy sources.\\n \\nBased on policies and actions to achieve a low\\n-\\ncarbon transition, this forecast \\nprojects increasing use of renewables in the power generation sector, progress in \\nenergy efficiency and greater electrification of end\\n-\\nuse act\\nivities. Our modelling \\npredicts that electricity will meet 29% of global final energy consumption in 2050, \\ncompared to 21% in 2020. Additionally, it is the service sector that looks set to \\ndominate future growth in global GDP and the shift towards this sec\\ntor (both in \\ndeveloped and developing countries) will contribute to a faster rate of decline in the \\noverall level of energy intensity. Global primary energy intensity of GDP will decrease \\nby 2.4% per annum over the 2020\\n-\\n2050 period, compared to a reduction\\n \\nof 1.5% per \\nannum between 2000 and 2020.\\n \\nAccording to the RCS, global primary energy demand will rise by 29% over the next \\nthree decades, reaching 17,880 Mtoe by 2050 amid higher living standards, growing \\nprosperity and better access to energy in some reg\\nions. It remains 2% lower than we \\n\\n-\\nCOVID recovery is offset by efficiency gains. \\nA look at the regional breakdown of primary energy demand demonstrates that 2,275 \\nMtoe or around 56% of the global increase between 202\\n0 and 2050 will stem from \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nregion, while the fast\\n-\\ngrowing economies of China, India and South East \\nAsia will remain major contributors.

The Middle East and Latin America are expected to see \\ntheir demand \\nincrease by nearly 445 Mtoe and 375 Mtoe respectively in response to \\nsufficient energy supply and economic expansion. Eurasian demand will increase by \\n220 Mtoe and this modest growth is attributed to the significant \\npotential in energy \\nefficiency, achieved\\n \\nby the replacement of older energy\\n-\\nintensive capital equipment.\\n \\n \\n103\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFigure 3.\\n1\\n.

The use of efficient gas\\n-\\nbased technologies instead of coal in power generation will also play a role that is \\nin \\nline with \\nthe \\nproposed policy to achieve a net\\n-\\nzero US power sector. Conversely, \\nenergy demand in Europe will decrease over the outlook period.

Despite the expansion of oil usage in petrochemical manufacturing, efficiency \\nimprovements in the transport sector to\\ngether with greater penetration of alternative \\nfuels, such as electricity, natural gas and hydrogen, will outweigh these gains, \\npushing oil demand down. Lower oil demand will also be observed in the power \\ngeneration sector. At a regional and country level,\\n \\noil consumption will have a \\ncontrasting future. Declining demand is centred in developed countries, led by the \\nUS, Japan, South Korea and the majority of European markets, while all the growth \\nis projected to stem from developing markets, with India, Sout\\nheast Asia and African \\ncountries at the forefront.\\n \\nCoal demand is expected to decline by 35% to 2,400 Mtoe in 2050.

Furthermore, liquids demand is expressed in volumetric units (mb/d), thus \\naccounting for t\\nhe oil product mix and its evolution over time. This is why the figures shown in this box are not directly \\ncomparable to those in which primary energy demand for oil is shown in energy equivalent units (e.g. Mtoe).\\n \\nPrepared by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \\nSecretariat\\n \\nbased on the OPEC World Oil Outlook \\n2021\\n \\nFollowing an unprecedented decline of 9.3 mb/d in 2020, global liquids demand \\nstarted its recovery path in 2021, although this was far from a full revival, \\nespecially in the road transportation and aviation sectors. The recovery process \\nis set to cont\\ninue in 2022, despite the number of challenges and uncertainties \\nprimarily related to the omnipresent COVID\\n-\\n19 pandemic.\\n \\nAt the global level, liquids demand is projected to reach 103.6 mb/d by 2025, \\nwhich is 13 mb/d higher than in 2020. However, more than \\n80% of this incremental \\ndemand will materialize in the period to 2023, primarily as part of the recovery \\nprocess from the COVID\\n-\\n19 crisis. OECD liquids demand is projected to grow by \\nmore than 4 mb/d in the period to 2025 (compared to 2020). However, this \\nincrease will not be sufficient to return to pre\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19 demand levels in this \\nregion. In contrast, non\\n-\\nOECD demand is expected to increase by almost 9 mb/d \\nby 2025 from 48.6 mb/d observed in 2020, of which less than 4 mb/d will be \\nneeded to offset the de\\nmand decline in 2020.\\n \\nIn the long\\n-\\nterm, global liquids demand is forecast to rise by 17.6 mb/d between \\n2020 and 2045, growing from 90.6 mb/d in 2020 to 108.2 mb/d in 2045. Similar to \\nthe medium\\n-\\nterm prospects, long\\n-\\nterm projections even accentuate a contra\\nsting \\ndemand picture between continued growing demand in the non\\n-\\nOECD and \\ndeclining demand in the OECD. Indeed, OECD liquids demand is projected to\\n \\npeak at levels around 46.6 mb/d in 2023, before it starts a longer\\n-\\nterm decline\\n \\n \\n \\n108\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ntowards a level of 34 m\\nb/d by 2045.

More than 90% of this demand increase is \\nprojected to come from the road transport\\nation and aviation sectors, with each \\ncontributing around 6 mb/d, although a large part of these increases will be due \\nto the recovery from the sharp demand declines experienced in these two sectors \\nin 2020.\\n \\nProspects for the road transportation sector wil\\nl be impacted by rising penetration \\nof electric vehicles (EVs). Recent projections indicate that the total vehicle fleet \\nwill reach 2.6 billion by 2045, increasing by around 1.1 billion from the 2020 level. \\nEVs are set to approach 500 million by 2045, repr\\nesenting almost 20% of the \\nglobal fleet by then. Some growth is also projected for natural gas vehicles \\n(NGVs), with an expected increase of 80 million vehicles projected between 2020 \\nand 2045.\\n \\nAs a result, also considering efficiency improvements in futur\\ne oil\\n-\\nbased \\ninternal combustion vehicles and expected average mileage driven, 2045 liquids \\ndemand in the road transportation sector will be more than 6 mb/d higher \\ncompared to 2020. However, this will be just 1.6 mb/d higher compared to pre\\n-\\npandemic levels\\n \\nin 2019, despite the substantial increase in the number of \\nvehicles.

A counterbalancing \\ne\\nffect to this potential growth will come in the form of a quest for improved \\nefficiency and emissions reductions. The net effect of these trends will likely be a \\ndemand expansion by almost 6 mb/d during the forecast period, from 3.5 mb/d in \\n2020 to 9.3 mb/\\nd in 2045. Similar to other sectors, the larger part of this \\nincremental demand is projected for non\\n-\\nOECD countries (+3.5 mb/d), while total \\nOECD is set to grow by 2.3 mb/d.\\n \\nCompared to road transportation and aviation, the overall change between 2020 \\nand \\n2045 in the marine transport sector is 0.7 mb/d, with demand increasing \\nmostly in the period to 2030. This growth is partly related to offsetting the 2020 \\ndemand decline, with the rest driven by expanding international trade on the back \\nof robust economic \\ngrowth in developing countries. However, d\\nemand for marine \\nbunkers is projected to remain virtually flat afte\\nr 2030. During this period, LNG \\nvessels are expected to achieve sufficient penetration, and combined with higher \\nefficiency of oil\\n-\\nbased vessels, w\\nill counterbalance the still\\n-\\ngrowing trade.\\n \\nSome demand growth is also projected in the industrial sector, driven by strong \\ndemand for petrochemical products. The overall demand growth in the industrial \\nsector is forecast to be 4.9 mb/d, of which 4.3 mb/d \\nrelates to petrochemical \\nfeedstock.\\n \\nCombined, the residential, commercial and agricultural sectors account for around \\n12% of total \\noil demand. At the global level,\\n \\ndemand in this sector is projected to\\n \\n \\n \\n110\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ngrow by around 1 mb/d during the next 10\\n\\n15 years\\n \\nand then decline by around \\n0.5 mb/d by the end of the forecast period. This overall pattern results from varying \\ntrends between the major regions. Strict policy measures, especially for building \\ncodes and heating systems, combined with electrification and\\n \\nfuel substitution, is \\nexpected to cause OECD demand in this sector to slowly, albeit steadily, decline \\nduring the current decade. However, strong growth in the non\\n-\\nOECD region, \\nespecially India, China and Africa, is anticipated to offset demand losses in \\nthe \\nOECD and result in net growth of 1.3 mb/d in the period to 2035. Demand growth \\nin the non\\n-\\nOECD region will decelerate during the remaining part of the forecast \\nperiod, which, combined with declining demand in the OECD, is set to lead to an \\noverall dema\\nnd increase of around 0.7 mb/d by 2045.\\n \\n \\nFinally, electricity generation is the only sector in which liquids demand is forecast \\nto decline, a result of increasing competition from natural gas and renewables. \\nThe overall loss is projected at 1 mb/d between \\n2020 and 2045.\\n \\nAs the world gradually moves beyond COVID, stable and supportive oil market \\nfundamentals will also see recovery on the supply side. In particular, 2022 will see \\na return to growth for US tight oil production, which is expected to rise from \\n \\n11.5 mb/d in 2020 to 14.5 mb/d in 2025. Tight oil output is expected to peak at \\n15.2 mb/d in the late 2020s, with US total liquids hitting a maximum of around \\n \\n20.5 mb/d around the same time. Other significant contributors to non\\n-\\nOPEC \\nsupply growth in the \\nmedium\\n-\\nterm are Brazil, Russia, Guyana and Canada.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n6\\n.

The \\nrevision has come on the back of countries\\' commitments towards net\\n-\\nzero, which \\nare expected to affect gas demand especially in Europe and in the US, as well as \\nincreased policy support for renewables and alternative decarbonisation options, \\nsuch \\nas pervasive electrification, energy efficiency, deployment of biomethane and \\nlow\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen. Concerning the latter, a transition to green hydrogen will have \\na small impact on global gas demand. This is partially due to the deployment of blue \\nhydrogen\\n, a new gas growth sector, which will offset the displacement, but this effect \\nwill take varying shapes across different markets. Simultaneously, key determinants \\nwhich will ensure a resilient outlook for gas will be policy efforts aimed at air quality \\nimp\\nrovements, coal and oil\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching, and the development of CCS/CCUS \\n(including direct use of this technology at power plants and large industrial sites).\\n \\nAs for regional trends, \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nregion will see sustained gas demand growth and \\nwill make the largest contribution \\n\\n \\nmore than 45% of the additional global 1,785 bcm \\nthrough to 2050. Africa and the Middle Eastern markets will together be responsible \\nfor around 30% of incremental volumes\\n. In Europe, gas demand is forecast to go into \\ngradual decline amid adherence to environmental policies, energy efficiency gains \\nand advancement in renewables.\\n \\n\\n33% in 2020, to 39% in 2045.\\n \\nSignificant and sustained investments in the oil sector will be needed to meet \\nprojected demand. Cumulative \\ninvestment requirements in the oil sector amount \\nto $11.8 trillion in 2021\\n\\n2045 (in 2021 US dollars). Of this, 80% or $9.2 trillion, is \\ndirected towards the upstream, the bulk of which is in North America, as US tight \\noil, in particular, drives medium\\n-\\nterm\\n \\nnon\\n-\\nOPEC supply growth. Downstream and \\nmidstream investment needs, in order to expand and maintain the associated \\nrefinery, storage and pipeline systems required to bring oil to market, necessitate \\nanother $1.5 and $1.1 trillion, respectively.\\n \\n \\n112\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n7\\n.

Gas \\nconsumption will rise by 98% to 1,680 bcm by 2050 and will expand strongly across \\nall sectors. Power \\ngeneration will take a frontline role, accounting for 45% of the total \\ngas demand increase, although consum\\nption in industry, residential and commercial, \\nand transport sectors will also rise considerably. China, India and Indonesia will be \\nthe main contributors to additional gas demand growth in the region.\\n \\nIn \\nNorth America\\n, increasing policy pressure, mainly d\\nriven by the US commitment \\nto achieve carbon neutrality by mid\\n-\\ncentury plus a growing focus on cleaner energy, \\ncontributed to a downwards revision of gas demand in the region compared to our \\nprevious GGO. As a result, consumption will rise by 13% to 1,180 \\nbcm by 2050 with \\nMexico in the lead due to an ongoing strategy to add numerous CCGTs to its power \\ngrid. Demand in the US will peak in the early\\n \\n2030s, however gas will continue to play \\na remarkable role in the energy mix of this country.

Stronger \\ngas demand growth in the region will be constrained due to high potential for energy \\nsavings, especially\\n \\nin the power and heat generation sectors.\\n \\nIn the \\nMiddle East\\n, gas demand will grow by 59% to 805 bcm by 2050. The increase \\nin gas consumption will be driven by sustained \\neconomic growth, strong demographic \\ntrends and the scope for displacing oil products \\nin a range of sectors, mainly in power \\ngeneration. Given rising gas production, countries will also place more emphasis on \\nvalue\\n-\\nadded industries as a route towards economic diversification.

Nevertheless, \\nnatural g\\nas will remain resilient at least up until 2030 as emission\\n-\\nreduction\\n \\nmeasures \\nare expected to initially have more \\nimpact on coal and oil within the power generation \\nand transport sectors. Over the long\\n \\nterm, increased decarbonisation efforts through \\nenergy efficiency, electrification, renewables and low\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen, particularly \\ngreen hydrogen that will be introduced for a wide range of sectors, will create \\npressure for natural gas demand. The transport sector and blue hydrogen generation \\nwill pre\\nsent the best growth potential, partially offsetting declines in other sectors\\n.\\n \\nAfrica\\n \\nwill witness the highest growth rate in natural gas demand among all regions, \\nrising by 155% to 395 bcm by 2050, with Nigeria and Egypt leading the way. The \\navailability\\n \\nof rich gas reserves and the upbeat outlook for indigenous production offer \\nsignificant prospects for its increased domestic usage. Infrastructure expansion could \\nbe a potential obstacle in the region, but a number of countries have plans for pipeline \\ncon\\nstruction and network development to stimulate local consumption. Accelerated \\neconomic activity and a rising urban population, accompanied by an unprecedented \\nincrease in electricity demand, will be the key drivers.\\n \\nIn \\nLatin America\\n, gas demand will rise b\\ny 103% to 315 bcm by 2050. Over the next \\nthree decades natural gas will make the most significant in\\n-\\nroads, compared to other \\nforms of energy, being a major component in building a more sustainable energy \\nsystem. This growth will be supported by domestic g\\nas resources and government \\npolicies to promote gas in power generation, for industrial applications and in road \\ntransport. The development of gas\\n-\\nfired generation, including the bulk of LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower projects, will be a driving force thanks to the transiti\\non from fuel oil and an \\noverdependence on hydro to more diversified power supplies.

The shares of hydro and nuclear, despite output rising in \\nabsolute terms, will also decrease, although much less sharply, and will provide \\nnearly 11% and 7% of the power generat\\nion mix respectively in 2050. In its turn, gas\\n-\\nfired generation, which will meet around 16% of rising electricity needs over the \\nforecast horizon, will maintain its current share in the generation mix at 24% until the \\nearly 2030s, decreasing thereafter to \\n20% by 2050.

Besides \\ntraditional drivers, such as continued industrialisation in developing countries and \\npopulation growth, coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching will be the biggest opportunity for growth \\nand policies to curb emissions will also\\n \\nbe a strong catalyst, mainly in China and \\nIndia. Natural gas is expected to retain its place as the key fuel suited for medium \\nand high\\n-\\ntemperature processes as well as a feedstock for manufacturing \\npetrochemicals and chemicals. The growing availability o\\nf global LNG supplies will \\nalso support this trend. Among all the regions, Asia Pacific will represent more than \\n50% of growth in natural gas consumption in the industrial sector, followed by the \\nMiddle East and Eurasia markets, together responsible for ar\\nound 40% of sectoral \\nincremental volumes between 2020 and 2050.\\n \\nMoreover, CCUS has a potentially powerful role to play as the optimal way to reduce \\nemissions and to adapt to new environmental initiatives, such as the Carbon Border \\nAdjustment Mechanism. Man\\ny core industries that use natural\\n \\ngas are assumed to \\nstart equipping\\n \\nthemselves with CCUS, thereby enhancing the resilience of this fuel. \\nThe primary applications for CCUS will be in hard\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ndecarbonise industries, such as \\nsteel, cement, glass and fertili\\nzer, while the deployment of this technology at a much \\ngreater scale is expected in industrial clusters. It is worth adding that CCUS is already \\nat the centre of decarbonisation strategies of a number of countries, especially in \\nNorthwest Europe, which are\\n \\naiming to capitalise on their offshore geology to \\ndecarbonise key industries.\\n \\nBox 3.2. Decarbonisation of industrial clusters with carbon capture \\ntechnology\\n \\n \\nThere is a portfolio of decarbonisation options to reduce emissions from the \\nindustrial sector \\nincluding biofuels, electrification and hydrogen. However, cheaper \\ncarbon capture technologies have the biggest potential because of the low profit \\nmargins of some industries, such as steel and cement. Furt\\nhermore, the relative \\ntechnological\\n \\nreadiness play\\ns in favour of new developments.\\n \\nOne way to bring down the infrastructure cost of CO\\n2\\n \\ntransportation and storage is \\nthe emergence of networks. In 2021, the Global Status of CCS report by the Global \\nCCS Institute showed that the cost of transporting smaller\\n \\nflow rates of CO\\n2\\n \\nis \\nhigher than transporting higher flow rates. The same concept applies to storage \\nfacilities in subsurface reservoirs as it avoids the high capital expense of drilling \\nwells to access the reservoirs and it helps support the economics of\\n \\nsmall capturing \\nprojects. In this context, the application of CCUS in industrial clusters, which can \\npool infrastructure to capture, transport and store CO\\n2\\n \\nand optimize energy and \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nflows via sector coupling\\n,\\n \\nis one of the most promising solutions.\\n \\n \\n117\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n \\nThe transport \\nsector will become the third\\n-\\nlargest source of growth\\n, accounting for \\n15% of incremental gas demand. The rise in demand in road and marine transport is \\nprojected to be particularly robust, growing \\nby 270 bcm (or by 360%) to 345 bcm by \\n2050 on the back of policy initiatives aimed at abating emissions. The maj\\nority of gas \\ndemand growth will stem from the development of the global NGV market. Tougher \\nrules imposed by the IMO on shipping will further increase gas consumption\\n \\nin this \\narea, with shipowners already beginning to switch to LNG to reduce the carbon \\nint\\nensity of their fleets. The prospects for natural gas usage in \\nthe \\nroad and marine \\ntransport are presented below in a separate section.\\n \\nBlue hydrogen generation\\n \\nrepresents another major avenue for natural gas to \\nexpand. Currently, around 100 Mt of hydrogen\\n \\n(pure and in mixed form) is produced \\nworldwide, with low\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen accounting for less than 2% of the total. Natural \\ngas is the primary source of its generation, making up 60% of annual global hydrogen \\n\\ncals, refining and steel making, the \\nhydrogen industry is in its infancy. However, more than twenty countries have already \\ndeclared corresponding strategies and roadmaps, enhancing efforts to scale\\n \\nup the \\ndeployment of low\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen to supply power g\\neneration, industrial, \\nresidential and transport consumption. In this context, blue hydrogen is expected to \\nplay an important role, given its competitiveness, scalability and synergies with \\nexisting gas infrastructure.\\n \\nGlobal hydrogen production will incre\\nase 2.7\\n-\\nfold to reach 270 Mt by 2050, mostly \\ndriven by rising consumption in industry (including as a feedstock) and the transport \\nsector. In 2050, almost 60% of projected volumes will be provided by sustainable, \\nThe UK government, for instance, announced the funding of GBP0.8 billion to \\nsupport carbon capture infrastructure and also committed to establishing \\ncommercial frameworks to enable the development of a wide range of CCUS \\nprojects (1). Particularly, the Ze\\nro Carbon Humber and Net\\n-\\nZero Teesside projects \\naim to support industrial clusters in Humber and Teeside to achieve net\\n-\\nzero \\nemissions. The schemes envisage capturing 17 Mt CO\\n2\\n/year and 10 Mt CO\\n2\\n/year, \\nrespectively. This CO\\n2\\n \\nwill be transported through an \\n85 km pipeline to offshore \\nfacilities for storage. To increase the cost advantage, these two projects will make \\nup the East Coast Cluster and share a storage facility in the offshore Endurance \\naquifer in the Southern North Sea.\\n \\nAnother prime example is Nor\\nway. The Longship/Northern Lights project, the first \\ncross\\n-\\nborder project in the country, aims to store more than 5 Mt CO\\n2\\n/year from \\nindustries in Norway and elsewhere in Europe and then transport it to underground \\nstorage reservoirs. Initially it will inv\\nolve the capture of CO\\n2 \\nfrom the Brevik cement \\nfactory and the Oslo waste incinerations plant. Phase one of the project is \\nscheduled for 2024 with a capacity of up to 1.5 Mt CO\\n2\\n/year (2).\\n \\n \\n11\\n8\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nlow\\n-\\ncarbon technologies with blue hydrogen \\nachieving a 21% share. Growth potential \\nwill come from the development of an internationally traded hydrogen market \\n(somewhat similar to that seen for LNG today), which will have implications on natural \\ngas demand for blue hydrogen exporting countries. Sub\\nstitution of grey hydrogen \\nwith blue hydrogen in existing industrial applications will also take place. Overall, gas \\ndemand for blue hydrogen generation is forecast to grow by 220 bcm between 2020 \\nand 2050 and will develop in tandem with CCUS infrastructur\\ne development. Eurasia \\nand Europe, driven by Russia, the UK and Norway, will be responsible for almost \\n70% of the total increase in sectoral gas demand, followed by North America and the \\nMiddle East. Given the wide range of assessments for future global hy\\ndrogen \\nproduction and corresponding natural gas demand for its generation, the GGO \\nfeatures a separate Hydrogen scenario (Chapter 6).\\n \\nIn the \\nresidential and commercial\\n \\nsector, gas demand will rise by 120 bcm (or by \\n15%) to 935 bcm by 2050. The increase wil\\nl be much less dynamic than in other \\nsectors, as electrification, energy efficiency improvements, building retrofits and \\nalternative heating options (such as biomethane, hydrogen or renewables) will limit \\nthe scope for gas to develop. A structural decline \\nin consumption will be observed in \\nEurope but will be largely offset by potential growth in other regions, primarily in Asia \\nPacific amid switching from coal and LPG, the development of city gas distribution \\nand growing household connections.\\n \\nProspects of \\nnatural gas usage in \\nthe \\nroad and marine transport\\n \\nThe introduction of alternative fuels for the transport sector has become an integral \\npart of the energy policy of countries that are implementing active climate and \\nenvironmental agendas. In this context,\\n \\nthe transition to low\\n-\\ncarbon transport \\nsystems creates a new promising source of natural gas demand.

It is worth mentioning that the use of NGVs \\ndoes not require investment in power generation, while the transition to e\\n-\\nmobility \\nimplies a mandatory change in the power generation mix.

Favourable government \\npolicies, regulatory frameworks and the expansion of refuelling infrastructure will be \\ndriving forces. The development of b\\niomethane and bio\\n-\\nLNG is also of crucial \\nimportance, as it provides additional opportunity for natural gas expansion.

Accordingly, anticipated \\nrestrictions on\\n \\ndiesel truck movements in a range of countries and large cities open \\nup prospects for CNG and specifically for LNG powertrains, capable of delivering \\nlengthy driving ranges.

To phase out high\\n-\\nsulphur fuel oil, shipowners \\nhave responded by investing in exhaust gas cleaning systems, known as scrubbers, \\nand by switching to lower\\n-\\nsulphur but more expensive oil\\n-\\nbased fuels. These IMO \\nre\\ngulations have also accelerated the adoption of LNG with demand, outside of LNG \\ncarriers, increasing almost two\\n-\\nfold, compared to 2019, to over 2 bcm in 2020. Over \\nthe long\\n-\\n\\nwhich en\\nvisages a cut of GHG emissions from international shipping by 50% by 2050, \\nIn addition, LNG is starting to penetrate the HGV segment in India and the \\ngovernment is planni\\nng to convert 10% of its current fleet of 10 million trucks, which \\nuse predominantly diesel, to LNG by 2035. The country has also introduced a plan \\nto build 1,000 LNG stations by 2024 along main highway corridors. The initial 50 \\nstations are being set up o\\nn the Golden Quadrilateral highways, connecting the \\ncities of Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai (3).\\n \\nIn China, the rise of gas demand in road transport will be entire driven by LNG. The \\ncountry has nearly 600,000 LNG\\n-\\nfuelled trucks and buses, the largest\\n \\nsuch fleet in \\nthe world. The development of an extensive cryogenic supply chain, financial \\nsubsidies and local air quality policies, restricting diesel truck movements since \\n2017\\n-\\n2018 (mostly in Northern and Eastern provinces in the framework of the Blue\\n-\\nSky Defence plan), gave a strong push to increased sales of LNG\\n-\\nfuelled heavy \\ntrucks. The adoption of stringent emission standards across the country as well as \\neconomic and environmental gains over diesel trucks will support this trend.\\n \\nAt the same time, \\ngas demand from CNG vehicles will expand much more slowly, \\npeaking around 2030s. Despite a series of policy instruments including financial \\nand fiscal incentives (subsidies, tax exemptions and conversion programs), CNG \\ngrowth will be challenged by the deve\\nlopment of EVs, which are increasingly \\nfavoured for passenger or light commercial vehicles. There is goal of over 50% EV \\nsales by 2035 in accordance with 15\\n-\\nyears New Energy Automobile Industry \\nDevelopment Plan.\\n \\nAustralia and South Korea, adding together a\\nround 5 bcm, will also become \\npromising markets amid increasing use of LNG in the HGV segment. Bangladesh, \\nPakistan and Thailand conversely will see moderate growth in demand. Despite \\nsizeable CNG fleets and developed refuelling infrastructure, further ado\\nption of \\nNGVs in these countries could be hindered by the existing gas allocation policy, \\nwhich ranks CNG users as a low priority during times of domestic gas shortages. \\nIn this context, growing imports of LNG could provide relief to current limitations.\\n \\n \\n122\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nin addition to a reduction in carbon intensity by 40% by 2030 and efforts towards \\nachieving 70% by 2050, compared to 2008 levels (4).\\n \\nThe uptake of LNG has been predominantly visibl\\ne in orders for larger vessels, \\nincluding crude carriers, such as Aframax tankers, cruise ships and ultra large \\ncontainer ships.

I\\nt is \\nexpected that recent flurry of orders for LNG\\n-\\npowered vessels will maintain high \\nexpectations in terms of fuel use at a global level and will bring about material gains \\nin associated emission savings, specifically for long\\n-\\nhaul shipping.\\n \\nLNG is in a g\\nood position to offer enhanced competitiveness thanks to the existing \\ngas infrastructure and supply chains as well as being able to provide significant \\nadvantages by complying with future requirements for the major types of emissions \\nand improvement in ove\\nrall air quality. Compared to oil\\n-\\nbased marine fuels, LNG \\nalmost eliminates sulphur oxides (SO\\nx\\n), particulate matter (PM) and emits up to 95% \\nless nitrogen oxides (NO\\nx\\n). Another factor in its favour is the 20\\n-\\n25% reduction in CO\\n2\\n \\nemitted. Various studies h\\nave shown a clear reduction in GHG emissions on a full \\nwell\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nwake lifecycle basis \\n\\n \\nup to 23% compared with the use of very low sulphur \\nfuel oil, when two\\n-\\nstroke slow\\n-\\nspeed engines are used (5). These gains could be \\nincreased further with improvements in\\n \\nreducing methane emissions along the LNG \\nsupply chain. In addition, methane slip in LNG engines does not present a serious \\nhurdle and is on track to being eliminated.\\n \\n\\ntargets\\n \\nand shipowners are considering alternatives fuels, such as hydrogen, \\nammonia, methanol, biofuels and electric batteries. However, many of them are in a \\nnascent stage of development and have commercial and technical limitations. For \\ninstance, while electri\\nc vessels could be an option for inland and short\\n-\\nsea routes, \\nthere is a problem with long sea voyages requiring large\\n-\\nscale battery packs. Zero\\n-\\ncarbon fuels, such as ammonia and hydrogen (either blue or green), still need \\nconsiderable research, extensive \\noperational testing and regulatory frameworks.\\n \\nSpecifically, the shipping industry is hopeful about the use of ammonia, as supply \\nand distribution networks exist around the world, given its widespread use as a \\nfertiliser.

LNG\\n-\\npowered containerships, crude oil tankers, oil \\nproduct/chemical tankers, bulk carriers\\n \\nand cruise ships account for the majority of \\norders, resulting in substantial change in demand in the future. Simultaneously this \\ngives confidence to fuel suppliers to invest in bunkering operations. Moreover, over \\n200 ships in the existing fleet and unde\\n\\n-\\n\\nthe technology to use LNG as an alternative fuel), and this could result in additional \\npotential for further LNG demand.\\n \\nA number of European and Asia Pacific shipping companies have started to shift their \\nflee\\nt to LNG with particular companies taking the lead. For example, in April 2021, \\nCMA CGM placed an order for twelve LNG\\n-\\nfuelled container ships (with the capacity \\nof 13,000 TEU and 15,000 TEU) to be delivered in 2023\\n-\\n24. The French company is \\ninvesting heav\\nily in LNG as a fuel and expects to have 44 LNG\\n-\\npowered ships in its \\nfleet by 2024 (8). In June 2021, German shipping line Hapag\\n-\\nLloyd ordered six ultra \\nlarge container vessels (over 23,500 TEU) with deliveries to begin in 2024. The \\ncompany had already pla\\nced an order for six ships of the same size at the end of \\n2020 and considers LNG as the most promising fuel on the path towards zero \\n\\n-\\npowered car carriers (loading \\ncapacity of about 7,000 vehicles each) in \\nJune 2021 with delivery expected between \\n2025 and 2029. By the end of 2028, the company aims to have twenty LNG\\n-\\nfuelled \\ntransporters, seeing LNG as a bridge solution until future zero emissions ships can \\nbe realized (10).\\n \\nThe bunkering infrastructure is re\\nsponding dynamically to the expansion of the \\nworld\\'s LNG\\n-\\npowered fleet and many more ports are projected to ensure refuelling \\ncapacity. According to Clarksons Research, at present 128 ports worldwide offer LNG \\nbunkering services, including ship\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nship, tr\\nuck\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nship, and shore\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nship transfers, \\ncompared with only 60 ports five years ago. Northwest Europe in particular has \\nreached a sufficient density of infrastructure, which allows shipowners to eliminate \\nthe risk of fuel supply availability from their ca\\nlculations when taking investment \\ndecisions over what propulsion system to opt for.\\n \\nAt the same time, ship\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nship bunkering services are expected to evolve rapidly as \\nthe most flexible and promising solution. Currently 32 bunkering vessels are active \\nand \\n25 are under construction. Some oil and gas companies are aiming to develop \\ntheir bunkering fleets and new players are entering this market. For example, Shell, \\nwhich has six bunkering vessels in operation, plans to double this number by 2025 to \\n \\n124\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nstrengthen\\n \\nits position in covering key international trade routes (11). In August 2021, \\n\\nvessel, was completed. The vessel will provide ship\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nship LNG transportation and \\nrefuelling \\nat ports throughout the Gulf of Finland and \\nthe \\nBaltic Sea (12). Looking \\nahead, Gazprom Neft is considering the addition of two more LNG bunkering vessels.\\n \\nRegulations will continue to be a fundamental driver behind the adoption of LNG. In \\nEurope, the grad\\n\\n\\n \\na strong \\nregulatory incentive for more shipowners who might be considering LNG as a fuel of \\nchoice. In addition, the\\n \\nestablishment of a Mediterranean ECA (expected to come \\ninto force in 2024) will have major consequences for LNG, accelerating the expansion \\nof refuelling infrastructure in this sub\\n-\\nregion and offering new point\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npoint routes \\namid growing trade as part o\\nf the development of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road \\n(a key component of China\\'s Belt and Road Initiative).\\n \\nSimultaneously, LNG bunkering looks promising in \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nregion given the \\nexisting extensive LNG infrastructure and government support bein\\ng a significant \\ncatalyst. In particular, Singapore is striving to become a key LNG bunkering hub for \\nthe region and the comprehensive Maritime Singapore Green Initiative, launched in \\n2011 and extended until the end of 2024, has a new focus on the decarboni\\nsation of \\nshipping. The country provides grants for the construction of LNG\\n-\\npowered vessels, \\nwhile vessels with LNG engines are eligible for discounts on port dues. The South \\nKorean government has decided to offer tax rebates for LNG\\n-\\npowered ships starting\\n \\nfrom 2021 as part of its efforts to develop LNG bunkering services and meet strict \\nmarine fuel regulations (13). In Japan, the ports of Tokyo, Yokohama and Kawasaki \\nwaive entry fees for ships powered by LNG (the exemption runs for five years from \\nApril 20\\n21) (14).\\n \\nDevelopment of the LNG\\n-\\npowered fleet for inland rivers is also forecast, with a large \\nportion of demand coming from China amid government plans to promote water \\ntransportation systems for natural gas usage along the Yangtze River and other major \\nchannels. Total LNG demand for domestic shipping will reach 9 bcm by 2050.\\n \\nBy and large, global marine LNG demand will accelerate post\\n-\\n2025. In the mid\\n-\\nterm \\nLNG propulsion will face competition from low\\n-\\nsulphur oil products as well as the \\ninstallation of \\nscrubbers. The economics of retro\\n-\\nfitting and LNG\\n-\\nfuelled engines are \\nnot good compared with scrubbers, but it is expected that new ships will increasingly \\nbe constructed with LNG engines. As a result, the move to LNG will be gradual with \\ndemand centres co\\nncentrated in North America (mainly the US), Asia Pacific (China, \\nSouth Korea, Singapore, Japan) and a range of European countries.\\n \\nStricter environmental regulations, such as the existing 0.1% limit on sulphur content \\nwithin the ECAs, as well as local res\\ntrictions applying to open\\n-\\nloop scrubbers \\n \\n125\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n(particularly due to concerns about the disposal of sulphur\\n-\\nrich wash water and other \\nwaste products) will play an important role. Some ports like Singapore do not allow \\nships with open\\n-\\nloop scrubbers to discharge \\nscrubber wash water in the port.\\n \\nOverall, in 2050, the total demand of bunker fuels is projected to be around 240\\n \\nMtoe. \\nThanks to the combination of environmental advantages and increasing availability, \\nthe share of LNG in the global bunker fuel market wil\\nl rise from 3% in 2020 to 32% \\nby 2050. Accordingly, LNG demand in marine transport is forecast to reach 90 bcm \\nby 2050, compared to 10 bcm in 2020 (which is currently mostly consumed as LNG \\nboil\\n-\\noff gas). Hydrogen\\n-\\nbased fuels are seen as the next generatio\\nn fuel for shipping \\nand will potentially start to penetrate the shipping sector after 2030. As it could take \\nseveral decades for the fleet to move to zero\\n-\\ncarbon fuels, LNG will continue to \\nprovide an efficient alternative to conventional fuels in the long\\n-\\nterm.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n12\\n.

At present, coal meets more than 46% \\nof the energy needs in the region, but the main trait that unites countries is policy shift \\nto impro\\nve air quality, reduce pollution and emissions. In this context, natural gas, as \\none of the most environmentally\\n-\\nfriendly fossil fuels and the best currently available \\nsolution to displace coal and oil\\n-\\nbased fuels, is set to play a frontline role to meet \\nr\\nising energy demand and sustain expected economic growth, while remaining a pillar \\nof the energy transition strategy for the majority of countries in this region.\\n \\n0\\n50\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n250\\n300\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\n0%\\n20%\\n40%\\n60%\\n80%\\n100%\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nNatural gas\\nFuel oil\\nDiesel\\nElectricity\\nHydrogen-based fuels\\nOther fuels\\n \\n126\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nGas demand in \\nAsia Pacific\\n \\nis projected to almost double, rising at a strong rate of \\n2.3% per\\n \\nannum, from 850 bcm in 2020 to 1,680 bcm by 2050. This growth will \\naccount for more than 45% of incremental global gas demand within the outlook \\nperiod. The share of gas in the regional energy mix will grow in tandem, from 12% in \\n2020 to 17% in 2050. Gas \\ndemand will increase across all sectors driven by surging \\nelectricity demand, general economic and population dynamics, policy measures \\nencouraging coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching, significant investments in gas infrastructure, \\nincluding the expansion of transmissio\\nn and distribution networks, and efforts to \\nliberalise gas markets. \\n \\nSimultaneously, the introduction of decarbonisation options for gas through \\nCCS/CCUS technology (which is expected to develop, assisted by the introduction of \\nmandates) and blue hydrogen \\nproduction will shore up long\\n-\\nterm natural gas \\nconsumption trends, improving its environmental credentials. Adoption of green \\nhydrogen production, particularly for some industrial applications, and the integration \\nof imported low\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen is also fo\\nrecast, however this fuel is not expected \\nto have a significant impact on natural gas demand in the region before 2040, given \\nthe enormous potential for oil and coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching.\\n \\nFrom a sectoral perspective, the power generation and industry will keep\\n \\ntheir leading \\nroles, responsible for around 65% of total regional gas demand growth. Power \\ngeneration \\n\\n \\nthe largest consumer of gas in many markets across Asia Pacific \\n\\n \\naccounts for the single largest share of growth (45%), adding around 375 bcm \\nthrough \\n\\nelectricity demand in Asia Pacific will surge amid higher living standards, an \\nexpanding service sector and higher industrial output.

As a result, the share of coa\\nl in \\nthe regional generation mix will drop dramatically to 22% by 2050, compared with its \\ncurrent dominant position. Nevertheless, growing electricity demand\\n \\nwill keep coal \\nrelevant, particularly in India, China and Indonesia, remaining an important source\\n \\ndue to security and affordability reasons.\\n \\nIn contrast to coal, gas\\n-\\nfired generation is favoured across all the markets in Asia \\nPacific. New gas\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower infrastructure and regulatory initiatives will support \\n \\n127\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nadditional gas demand in China and India. In S\\nouth Korea, the prospects for gas in \\npower generation are also bright thanks to a policy to switch away from coal and \\nnuclear. Moreover, the power generation sector will be the main area of gas demand \\nexpansion in Bangladesh and Pakistan as well as the ASE\\nAN community, as the \\nconstruction of gas\\n-\\nfired generation is expected to take priority and numerous \\nprojects have been approved or planned. However these countries will become more \\nreliant on LNG as local gas production depletes.\\n \\nKeeping on track with thei\\nr environmental goals means that countries in Asia Pacific \\n\\npolicy targets and improving costs, renewables will continue to increase their share, \\nrising from 9% at present to \\n42% of the power generation mix in the region by 2050. \\nAccordingly, gas\\n-\\nfired generation will be in demand to facilitate the integration of \\nvariable solar and wind capacities and to enhance the flexibility of power systems, as \\nintermittency issues remain. \\nOver the forecast period, competition from renewables, \\nbattery storage and hydrogen in some markets (e.g. Japan, South Korea) will \\nescalate, constraining healthy sectoral gas demand growth in the region post\\n-\\n2040. \\nNevertheless, gas demand for power generat\\nion is not expected to peak during the \\nforecast period, as electricity requirements are very strong.\\n \\nOverall, with the assumption that nuclear capacity in Asia Pacific will also expand, \\npredominantly in China in the context of continued diversification fro\\nm coal and as a \\npart of the long\\n-\\nterm decarbonisation solution, gas\\n-\\nfired generation in the region will \\nremain stable with a 12.5\\n-\\n13% share over the forecast horizon.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n13\\n.

Gas \\nwill be increasingly used to provide heat and steam across energy\\n-\\nintensive \\nindustries, specifically for chemical and petrochemical production, non\\n-\\nmetallic \\nminerals (e.g. cement, ceramic, glass etc.) and a broad range \\nof light manufacturing. \\nMoreover, demand will rise for non\\n-\\nenergy uses, underpinned by an expanding \\npopulation in the region and its need for fertilisers, ammonia and other high\\n-\\nvalue \\nchemicals. Given that the increase in industrial gas demand will largely\\n \\nmirror the \\ndrop in coal and oil\\n-\\nbased fuel use in boilers, furnaces and kilns or as a chemical \\nfeedstock, stricter emission controls, new pipeline capacity and more competitive gas \\nprices could result in extra fuel\\n-\\nswitching opportunities in the region. I\\nt is estimated, \\nthat around 80% of incremental gas demand in industry will originate in China and \\nIndia. Meanwhile, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan will also see sizeable growth \\nin this sector.\\n \\nThe residential and commercial sector will provide an addit\\nional 140 bcm over the \\nforecast period on the back of accelerated urbanisation, wealthier households and \\ncontinued switching from coal and LPG across urban and rural areas. China will be \\nthe pivotal market for this sector, accounting for around 85% of incr\\nemental usage of \\nnatural gas, driven by new connections and commitments of provinces to boost city \\ngas coverage. India will also contribute thanks to the ongoing roll\\n-\\nout of city gas \\ndistribution (CGD) networks in densely populated regions, including last\\n-\\nmile \\nconnectivity, however residential gas usage in this country will be mostly limited to \\ncooking.\\n \\nFinally, Asia Pacific is projected to be a very promising region for gas usage in the \\ntransport sector, rising by around 106 bcm to 152 bcm by 2050. Around \\n70% of the \\nincrease will result from efforts to promote CNG and LNG fuelled vehicles. China and \\nIndia, with their policy focus on air quality and strategies to expand refuelling stations, \\nwill lead this growth, together adding 63 bcm through to 2050 in the\\n \\nroad transport \\nsegment. Marine bunkering will represent another area for LNG application, where \\n\\n-\\nAsian \\nmaritime trade. Along with Singapore, which pioneered the development of LNG \\nb\\nunkering in the region, growing sales of LNG, particularly for international bunkering, \\nare expected to come from China, India, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.\\n \\nFrom a country perspective, China, India and Indonesia will be the main contributors \\nto increme\\nntal gas demand in the region, accounting for 51%, 17% and 7% of total \\ngrowth, respectively. The only country in Asia Pacific where a fall in gas demand is \\nforecast is Japan, as a result of nuclear restarts, a substantial growth of renewable \\ncapacity in ad\\ndition to the integration of imported hydrogen in the energy system post\\n-\\n2030.\\n \\n \\n \\n129\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFigure 3.\\n14\\n. \\nAsia Pacific natural gas demand by country and sector (bcm)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM \\n \\nIn \\nChina\\n, \\nthe policy framework continues to support growth in natural gas use. With \\nconcerns over air quality, the government sees natural gas as a key part of the \\ntransition to a cleaner energy system and is targeting to increase its share of the \\nenergy mix to 15% \\nin 2030. To reach this level, China is conducting a set of market \\nreforms aimed at domestic production ramp\\n-\\nups, boosting investments and improving \\nthird\\n-\\nparty access to infrastructure, including LNG terminals.

This report projects \\nthat China will cut coal use in the energy mix from 60% in 2\\n020 to 44% by 2030 and \\nto 23% by 2050.\\n \\nHowever, China is not on track to meet its gas target, mainly due to competition from \\nalternatives and its energy independence requirement.

In this context, a huge investment programme for \\nthe expansion of pipelines \\nand distribution grids is underway.

Due to difficulties in mobilisin\\ng funds and environmental \\nissues, 10 coal\\n-\\nfired plants (totalling 9.3 GW) out of 18 scheduled have been \\ncancelled (18). This move paves the way for LNG\\n-\\nbased CCGTs, renewables and \\nnuclear. Natural gas will remain an important source to meet growing power n\\needs, \\nretaining its dominant position with a 50% share of the power generation mix in 2050 \\n(at present gas supplies 76% of electricity). There are also opportunities for gas to \\ndisplace fuel oil generation, which accounted for 15% of electricity generated \\nin 2020. \\nIn the long\\n-\\nterm, the launch of a nuclear programme could limit strong LNG demand \\ngrowth.

This trend will be underpinned by higher gas usage in end\\n-\\nuse \\nsectors, particularly in the residential and commercial sector, as well as in power \\ngeneration\\n, although more pronounced growth wi\\nll be restrained by the depletion of \\nnational gas reserves. Additionally, natural gas in power generation is expected to \\nface strong competition from hydro, nuclear and renewables deployment under the \\nChina\\n-\\nPakistan Economic Corridor framework and in line \\n\\nGeneration Capacity Expansion Plan 2021\\n-\\n2030 (approved in August 2021), which \\nis aimed at indigenous fuel\\n-\\nbased generation and a shift to clean energy (19). This \\nwill lead to a gradual squeeze of gas in the energy mix from 33% to \\n22% between \\n2020 and 2050, while the share of gas in the generation mix will drop from 35% at \\npresent to 20% by 2050.\\n \\nTo offset the long\\n-\\nterm decline in its domestic gas production, Pakistan will rely more \\non imports. There are two interstate pipeline proj\\nects under construction (Iran\\n-\\nPakistan and Turkmenistan\\n-\\nAfghanistan\\n-\\nPakistan\\n-\\nIndia), however LNG supplies are \\nexpected to take the bulk of the strain to cater for growing gas demand. Pakistan \\ncommenced LNG imports with the commissioning of two receiving te\\nrminals at Port \\nQasim, Karachi in 2015 and 2017 and five new regasification terminals are already \\nplanned to come online in the coming decade. The development of transmission \\ninfrastructure to carry additional LNG volumes to the northern part of the countr\\ny will \\nbe required. In this context the construction of the Pakistan Stream Gas Pipeline \\nbetween Karachi and Lahore will play a crucial role in facilitating the deployment of \\n\\n \\nGas d\\nemand in \\nJapan\\n \\nand \\nSouth Korea\\n \\nwill take divergent paths over the forecast \\nperiod, driven by different policy developments (see Chapter 2, Japan and South \\nKorea section for more details), and the trajectory of gas usage will be mostly \\nsensitive to power sector trends and integration of\\n \\nimported hydrogen in the energy \\nsystem, backed by decarbonisation targets. In Japan, gas demand is set to decrease \\nfrom 101 bcm in 2020 to 76 bcm in 2050, but volumes will fluctuate. In the mid\\n-\\nterm, \\nnuclear restarts will lead to a decline in consumption,\\n \\nwhile after 2030 the role of gas \\nin the electricity supply will be enhanced amid the decommissioning of ageing nuclear \\nreactors and strengthened environmental restrictions on coal\\n-\\nfired power plants. \\nHowever, the rollout of renewables will put a pressure \\non CCGT output.\\n \\nIn South Korea, gas consumption will rise from 56 bcm in 2020 to over 70 bcm by \\n2050 (peaking in 2035\\n-\\n2040 with demand of 75\\n-\\n77 bcm). Additional demand will \\ncome from the transport and power generation sectors due to mounting focus on air \\np\\nollution, anti\\n-\\ncoal sentiments and restrictions on new nuclear construction.

In 2017, coal had already overtaken gas to become the primary source \\nof the regional \\npower generation mix and its dominance might persist given the \\ncapacity under construction (equal to 23.1\\n \\nGW), mostly in Indonesia, Vietnam and \\nthe Philippines \\n(20)\\n. Substantially more capacity (around 50\\n \\nGW) is at the pre\\n-\\nconstruction phase, although some\\n \\npotential projects are expected to be reviewed \\ndue to environmental considerations, rising public opposition as well as difficulties in \\nsecuring financing as more banks and financial institutions back away or tighten their \\npolicy towards coal\\n-\\npowered proj\\nects.\\n \\nA downwards revision of the number of coal\\n-\\n\\nrecently adopted plans and announcements. For example, in 2020 the Philippines \\nimplemented a moratorium on new coal\\n-\\nfired power plants (it will not concern projects \\nthat have already been approved or secured permits) (21). In Vietnam, within the \\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\n2500\\n3000\\nOther ASEAN\\nSingapore\\nCambodia\\nMyanmar\\nMalaysia\\nThailand\\nPhilippines\\nVietnam\\nIndonesia\\n \\n137\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ndraft National Power Development Plan for the period of 2021\\n-\\n2030 with a vision to \\n2045 (draft PDP8, proposal as of September 2021), almost half of previously planned \\ncoal\\n-\\nfi\\nred projects under the amended PDP7 could be cancelled or delayed until after \\n2030 (except those already under construction and under investment designed for \\noperation during 2021 to 2025). The draft also claims that the power capacity ratio of \\ncoal\\n-\\nfired \\npower sources will gradually decrease compared to the current status (22). \\nMalaysia, in line with the country\\'s latest Generation Development Plan covering \\n2021\\n-\\n39, intends to retire over 7\\n \\nGW of coal\\n-\\nfired capacity by 2039 and only 2.8\\n \\nGW \\nof new coal\\n-\\nfire\\nd projects should be commissioned in that time (23).\\n \\nIn Indonesia, where coal supplies more than 60% of electricity, there remains a \\ndetermination to reduce the dominance of this source of fuel. The government has \\ndeclared plans to replace the old coal\\n-\\nfir\\ned fleet (aged 20 years and older, which \\naccounts for a combined capacity of over 11\\n \\nGW) with cleaner power sources. \\nMoreover, Indonesia has set a net\\n-\\nzero emissions target by 2060 as part of its long\\n-\\nterm strategy for reducing carbon emissions and improvi\\nng climate resilience. This \\ndecision will slow down the ramp\\n-\\nup of coal\\n-\\nfired generation in the country, which has \\nthe largest pipeline of coal projects in the region.\\n \\nIn this context, countries have started to place greater emphasis on the expansion of \\nna\\ntural gas use and renewables. In terms of renewables, ASEAN set a target of a \\n35% share in the total installed power capacity by 2025. This will contribute to \\nachieving the aspirational target of achieving a 23% share for renewable energy in \\nthe regional e\\nnergy mix by 2025. Under this vision around 40\\n \\nGW of renewable \\nenergy capacity is to be added by that date. Alongside this regional target, individual \\ncountries envision a further push for renewables\\n-\\nbased power and a myriad of \\nmeasures, such as a revision\\n \\nof feed\\n-\\nin tariffs, net\\n-\\nmetering schemes, auction \\nmechanisms and facilitating access to land and surface water for floating projects, \\nare envisaged to support the development.\\n \\nThere are strong ambitions for the scaling\\n-\\nup of renewables. Vietnam, in its base\\n-\\nload scenario of the draft PDP8, is aiming for around 30 GW of wind and solar \\ncapacity by 2030 and almost 100 GW by 2045 when its share will reach 38% of total \\ninstalled capa\\ncity. Currently untapped wind power is anticipated to lead the increase, \\naccounting for 47\\n \\nGW of growth between 2020 and 2045. Thailand, within its Power \\nDevelopment Plan (PDP 2018 Rev.1), aims to cover 33% of its electricity needs from \\nrenewables (includi\\nng hydro) by 2037. Renewables are set to reach 29\\n \\nGW, \\namounting to around 35% of total installed capacity in 2037 (24). The Philippines, in \\nthe draft of the new version of its National Renewable Energy Program, has set a \\n\\nsha\\nre in the power generation mix of 37% by 2030 \\nand 56% by 2040 (25). Indonesia also aims to increase substantially the role of \\nrenewables in electricity generation. This aim is underpinned by an overall policy \\norientation to raise their share in the primary\\n \\nenergy mix from 9% in 2020 to 23% by \\n2025 and 31% by 2050. In accordance with the National Electricity Supply Business \\n \\n138\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nPlan 2021\\n-\\n2030, renewables power plants (including hydro) will account for 51.6% of \\nthe planned 40,575 MW power generation projects to \\nbe developed in this timeframe \\n(26).\\n \\nDespite these ambitious plans, several challenges are expected to affect the pace of \\n\\nttent renewable energy will \\nbe hindered by: 1)\\n \\neconomic difficulties in fundi\\nng costly projects post\\n-\\nCOVID\\n-\\n19; \\n2)\\n \\nbottlenecks in the electricity transmission networks; 3)\\n \\ncurrent underinvestment in \\ngrid modernisation; 4)\\n \\ninsufficient availability of land to allocate large\\n-\\nscale renewable \\nprojects; and, 5)\\n \\nthe existing inflexibility\\n \\nof power systems dominated by coal\\n-\\nfired \\ngeneration. This is where gas\\n-\\nfired power plants will play a critical role regionally, \\nbeing a significant component for the transition away from coal\\n-\\nfired generation, while \\ncomplementing variable renewables, and \\nstabilising ever\\n-\\nmore complex grids.\\n \\nIn general, a number of ASEAN countries are highly reliant on natural gas for \\nelectricity. With an average share in the regional power generation mix of around \\n33%, in 2020 this fuel accounted for 97% in Singapore, 68% \\nin Thailand, 49% in \\nMyanmar and 34% in Malaysia, while it played a more modest role in Vietnam, the \\nPhilippines and Indonesia, amounting to 20%, 21%, and 20%, respectively. The \\npotential for coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching as well as strong electricity demand growth\\n \\nmean \\nthat natural gas could maintain or even strengthen its position over the next few \\ndecades. The key drivers will be the availability of indigenous gas production, as \\nmany countries face the depletion of their existing domestic assets, and the ability \\nto \\ncreate import opportunities for LNG.\\n \\nPolicy incentives and ongoing market reforms, which support competition and attract \\nupstream and infrastructure investments, are assumed to slow down the long\\n-\\nterm \\ndecline of regional domestic gas production. Recent \\ndiscoveries, including large ones \\nsuch as Ken Bau in Vietnam, Lang Lebah in Malaysia and Kali Berau Dalam in \\nIndonesia, are expected to sustain this trend, although the development of some \\nprojects could be hindered due to difficult geographical (i.e. loca\\nted far away from \\ndemand centres) and geological conditions, in addition to problems of impurities and \\ncontaminations. Thus, taking into account the rising natural gas usage in the power \\ngeneration, industry and transport sectors, this report considers tha\\nt the ASEAN \\nregion as a whole will transform into a net gas importer in 2027\\n-\\n2028.\\n \\nThis will bring LNG imports to the forefront, while the development of LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower \\nsupply chains and interconnectivity, including the Trans\\n-\\nASEAN Gas Pipeline project, \\nwill\\n \\nbe \\npivotal factors, facilitating the uptake of LNG in the region. At the moment, \\nthere are nine LNG receiving terminals in five ASEAN countries with a total capacity \\nof 38.75 mtpa and regasification capacity will grow rapidly. Singapore is looking to \\nbeco\\nme a leading gas hub\\n \\nin the region and there is also an alternative project for \\nthe creation of a gas hub in Thailand, based on a receiving terminal in Map Ta Phut.\\n \\n \\n139\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nA strong impetus will come from the advancement of intra\\n-\\ncountry LNG trade in \\nIndonesia, ma\\nking gas accessible to the entirety of the archipelago. The long\\n-\\nterm \\ninfrastructure plan envisages the allocation of small\\n-\\nscale terminals coupled with \\nintegrated generators across 32 locations in Jawa, Sulawesi and West Kalimantan. \\nThere has been also an\\n \\nannouncement that the government will begin to build a \\nsystem of seaborne electricity supply networks, powered by LNG, in order to deliver \\nelectricity to islands (up to ten islands at the initial stage of the plan) that currently \\nrely on diesel generation\\n \\nunits (27). Moreover, Indonesia plans to launch its first LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower project, the 1.76\\n \\nGW Java\\n-\\n1 plant integrated with a floating storage and \\nregasification unit (FSRU).\\n \\nMeanwhile, Myanmar has commissioned its first 477\\n \\nMW LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower plant in \\nThaketa \\nin June 2020 and LNG import facility, located on the Yangon River, and also \\nbegan to supply natural gas to the 350\\n \\nMW power plant in Thanlyin and the 150\\n \\nMW \\nfacility in Kyaukpyu. Another gas\\n-\\nfired power plant in Thilawa (1.2\\n \\nGW), sourced by \\nLNG, is expecte\\nd to come online by 2024. With the aim of achieving universal \\nelectricity access by 2030, Myanmar plans to boost gas\\n-\\nfired power plant deployment \\nand is building six LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower projects with a total installed capacity of 4\\n \\nGW (28).\\n \\nPerhaps the most vibra\\nnt example of development in this sphere is in Vietnam. The \\ncountr\\ny is not yet importing LNG, but plans, unveiled in the draft PDP8, are attracting \\n\\n-\\nload scenario proposes a significant ramp\\n-\\nup of gas\\n-\\nfired capaci\\nty from 7\\n \\nGW in 2020 to 27\\n \\nGW by 2030 and 62\\n \\nGW by 2045, \\nwith additional capacities to be mainly LNG\\n-\\nbased. Hai Linh\\'s LNG terminal in Vung \\nTau\\n-\\nBa Ria province is on track to become the first LNG regasification project in \\nVietnam and will supply the Hiep P\\nhuoc power plant expansion with up to 1.2\\n \\nGW of \\ncapacity. Another receiving terminal at Thi Vai is under construction (phase 1 is set \\nto be completed in 2022\\n-\\n2023) and will be used to fuel new power plants Nhon Trach \\n3\\n \\n&\\n \\n4 (total capacity of 1.5\\n \\nGW). Furth\\ner down the line, the Bac Lieu LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower \\nproject (3.2 GW) in the Mekong Delta region is being targeted for start\\n-\\nup in 2024 \\n(29). In October 2021, the government of Vietnam approved the first phase of the Hai \\nLang LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower project (1.5\\n \\nGW) in the Qu\\nang Tri province, which is expected to \\ncome online in 2026\\n-\\n2027 (30).\\n \\nIn line with the increase in electricity demand in ASEAN, electricity generation is \\nforecast to grow 2.8\\n-\\nfold to about 3,040\\n \\nTWh in 2050. Considering projects under \\nconstruction as well \\nas an assessment of energy policies and long\\n-\\nterm capacity \\n\\n900\\n \\nGW in 2050. Coal will continue to expand across ASEAN \\n\\n \\ntotal coal\\n-\\nfired \\ncapacity will reach 136\\n \\nGW in 2040\\n \\n(net capacity additions of 46\\n \\nGW), but will drop \\nto 126\\n \\nGW by 2050. Gas\\n-\\nfired capacity will rise from 101\\n \\nGW to nearly 240\\n \\nGW by \\nmid\\n-\\ncentury, driven by developments in Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, \\nMyanmar and Thailand. Renewables \\n\\n \\nsolar, wind and\\n \\ngeothermal \\n\\n \\nwill comprise \\n62% of all capacity additions, \\nrising by 380\\n \\nGW between 2020 and 2050.\\n \\nHydropower \\n \\n140\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nwill contribute 6%, adding 36 GW between 2020 and 2050. The development of the \\nASEAN Power Grid is also taken into consideration, which will faci\\nlitate the promotion \\nand scaling\\n-\\nup of renewables.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n21\\n. ASEAN installed generation capacity by technology (GW)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nGas\\n-\\nfired generation is forecast to contribute \\nto almost 40% of the increase in \\nelectricity supply through to 2050. This will translate into higher natural gas demand \\nfor ASEAN countries in the power generation sector, adding about 140 bcm over the \\nnext three decades to reach 223\\n \\nbcm in 2050. LNG will \\nbridge a widening gap of field \\ndepletion and lack of new indigenous resources; however more pronounced sectoral \\ngas demand growth will be stifled by competition from cheaper coal that will be critical \\nto revitalising economies in the aftermath of COVID\\n-\\n19 \\nand to keep pace with growing \\nelectricity needs. It is also expected that ASEAN countries will experience some \\ndelays in the commissioning of regasification terminals and new gas\\n-\\nfired power \\ncapacities, impacted by capital spending cuts. At the same time, \\nalthough the \\nexistence of abundant and cheap coal resources cannot be simply set aside, there is \\neven larger potential for coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching in the power sector if more favourable \\npolicy measures are undertaken and gas\\n-\\nbased infrastructure affordabilit\\ny grows.\\n \\nOverall, coal is projected to ensure 37% by 2030 and 20% by 2050 of the total \\nregional electricity supply. In its turn, gas\\n-\\nfired generation, based on indigenous gas \\nproduction and LNG imports, is set to maintain a strong foothold and will become \\nthe \\nlargest generation source, providing above 35% of the power generation mix after \\n2040. Renewables, on the strength of policy support and declining technology costs, \\nare starting to alter the mix that \\n-\\n \\ntogether with expanding hydropower \\n-\\n \\nwill meet 50%\\n \\nof the projected increase in total power output.

In this context, gas\\n-\\nfired \\npower plants, given their effective baseload operations, flexibility options and shor\\nt \\nstart\\n-\\nup times, will play a central role, specifically beyond 2030, helping to sustain the \\ntransition away from more carbon\\n-\\nintensive coal and accommodate a higher share of \\nrenewables into the grid.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n22\\n. \\nASEAN power ge\\nneration by fuel (TWh) and fuel shares (%)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nNote: Others include oil, bioenergy, nuclear and hydrogen\\n \\nNorth America\\n \\nIn North America, natural gas demand will grow by 0.4% per annum from 1,040 \\nbcm \\nin 2020 to 1,180 bcm in 2050 with Mexico in the lead, accounting for around 60% of \\nadditional volumes. Increasing policy pressure, mainly driven by US commitment to \\nachieve carbon neutrality by mid\\n-\\ncentury, and a growing focus on cleaner energy has \\ncon\\ntributed to a downward revision of gas demand in the region. Compared to the \\nprevious GGO, these assumptions have lowered demand in 2050 by 26% (or \\nreduction of 310 bcm). Despite a strengthened decarbonisation policy, natural gas is \\nexpected to be the domi\\nnant fuel in North America with its share in the regional \\nenergy mix enhanced from 35% to 39% over the outlook period.\\n \\nIn the power generation sector, natural gas is assumed to retain a considerable \\nshare. More coal plants in the US will be retired in the \\ncoming decade, while \\nsignificant expansion of gas\\n-\\nfired power capacity is forecast in Mexico. Even in \\nCanada, where the power system benefits from an abundance of hydroelectricity, \\nnatural gas will have the opportunity to replace existing coal\\n-\\nfired power \\nplants and \\nproviding flexibility to renewables. Demand in this sector will begin to decline in the \\nmid\\n-\\n2030s, after peaking at about 455 bcm, due to the assertive rise of renewables, \\n0\\n500\\n1000\\n1500\\n2000\\n2500\\n3000\\n3500\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nNatural Gas\\nOthers\\n0%\\n5%\\n10%\\n15%\\n20%\\n25%\\n30%\\n35%\\n40%\\n45%\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nNatural gas\\nCoal\\nHydro\\nRenewables\\nOthers\\n \\n142\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nmainly in the US, and \\nimprovements in battery storage technology.

In the US and Canada consumption in industry is expected to \\nbe relatively flat in the long\\n-\\nterm. For the residential and commercial sector, regional \\ndemand will stabilize, amounting to 264 bcm in 2050. In contrast, road and marine \\ntranspor\\nt will experience strong growth from 4 bcm in 2020 to almost 55 bcm by 2050, \\nmostly due to the development of the NGV market and a corresponding rise in CNG \\nand LNG\\n-\\npowered trucks. This trend will be overwhelmingly driven by the US.\\n \\nSimultaneously, about 2\\n5 bcm of additional gas is estimated to be consumed to \\ngenerate blue hydrogen. Given the low\\n-\\ncost nature of gas production and\\n \\navailability \\nof infrastructure to support capacity developments, the region is well positioned to \\nscale up blue hydrogen as a too\\nl to decarbonise the non\\n-\\npower sectors.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n23\\n. \\nNorth America natural gas demand by country and sector (bcm)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nIn the \\nUS\\n, natural gas demand will rise from 840 bcm in 2020 to peak in the early \\n2030s at about 915 bcm.

Building e\\nlectrification will \\naccelerate, but there is still an opportunity for oil\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching. In industry, gas \\ndemand will stabilize at about 202 bcm. This fuel is well protected in many industrial \\nprocesses, so on the back of rising GDP and new additions of\\n \\nmethanol and \\npetrochemical plants, gas demand, including as a feedstock, will continue despite \\nenergy efficiency improvements and penetration of low\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen. At the \\nsame time, a significant push for gas consumption will come from blue hydrogen \\ngen\\neration amid policy support, availability of gas infrastructure and deployment of \\nCCUS as well as the potential conversion of existing on\\n-\\nsite grey hydrogen \\ngeneration sites, particularly within industrial facilities for methanol, ammonia and \\nrefining.\\n \\nRoa\\nd and marine transport represent another growth opportunity for gas demand. \\nCurrently very negligible volumes of marine bunkering will rise to about 12 bcm in \\n2050 (including LNG boil\\n-\\noff), supported by conversions to LNG\\n-\\npowered vessels \\nand new builds. In\\n \\nroad transport, the increase is more vivid, accounting for 32 bcm \\nof additional demand. Along with the availability of low\\n-\\ncost gas arising from shale \\ngas production, the basis of the strong outlook is the use of LNG in the HGV segment \\nand environmental b\\nenefits. Future demand will also be buoyed by the expansion of \\nrequisite infrastructure with private sector investments.\\n \\nNatural gas is already used as a vehicle fuel by Amazon, UPS and Waste \\nManagement, amongst many other fleet owners. US policy supports \\nNGVs, as almost \\nall state governments provide incentives through fuel tax reductions, reduced vehicle \\nsale taxes, grants and lower registration fees. For example, in June 2021, the \\ngovernor of Texas signed a bill to expand the current grant programme for N\\nGVs to \\ninclude used models. This programme is the first of its kind in the US and provides \\nlarger fleets with a marketplace for their retired NGVs while helping small business \\nowners with finance to purchase newer, clean\\n-\\nburning NGVs (31).\\n \\nIn the power \\ngeneration sector natural gas will experience a contrasting trend, \\nreflecting the announced goal of a 100% carbon\\n-\\nfree electricity supply by 2035. Over \\nthe next decade natural gas will mostly benefit from a transition away from coal, given \\nthe scope for la\\nrge\\n-\\nscale switching. Coal\\n-\\nfired capacity has started to decline since \\n2011 to 238\\n \\nGW\\n \\n\\nexpects an acceleration of coal plant closures, leaving coal to make up just 1% of the \\npower generation \\nmix in 2035, compared to 20% in 2020. Nuclear power, the \\ntechnology which is envisaged by the Administration as part of the low\\n-\\ncarbon future, \\nis also projected to be in decline: the existing fleet (101 GW as of 2020), constructed \\nmostly in 1970s and 1980s\\n, is under severe pressure, while new reactors are \\nexpensive to build and only two units are currently under construction. The proposed \\nEECES programme could help support nuclear plants, but its future remains \\nuncertain. Based on policy assessments and ass\\numptions on nuclear life extensions, \\n \\n144\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nnuclear is expected to account for 16% of the power generation mix in 2035 and 6% \\nin 2050, down from 19% in 2020.\\n \\nThus, the resilience of natural gas will come at the expense of coal and, to a lesser \\nextent, nuclear. De\\nmand will rise to a peak of 360\\n-\\n365 bcm in early 2030s. However, \\nit will decrease to 275 bcm by 2050 (21% lower than 2020 level) amid aggressive \\nrenewable buildout and the deployment of energy storage systems, such as stand\\n-\\nalone batteries or solar/battery\\n \\nhybrid systems. Nevertheless, achieving a net\\n-\\nzero \\npower sector by 2035 will be challenging and 64% of clean power generation appears \\na more feasible target. In its turn, gas\\n-\\nfired power generation is forecast to provide \\n35% of the total in 2035 and 25% i\\nn 2050. The integration of CCGT fitted with CCUS \\nwill be a valuable solution to contribute to reducing US carbon emissions in the power \\nsystem.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n24\\n. \\nUS power generation by fuel (TWh) and fuel shares (%)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF\\n \\nSecretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nNote: Others include oil, bioenergy and hydrogen\\n \\nIn \\nMexico\\n \\nnatural gas demand will keep growing from 83 bcm in 2020 to more than \\n165 bcm by 2050.

Due to improvements in heating supply modes and refurbishment of the CHP \\nfleet, primarily in Russia, consumption in the heat generation sector across the region \\nis expected to dro\\np by 17% to less than 100 bcm by 2050. Conversely, gas demand \\nfor power generation will rise, but by just 10% or to almost 185 bcm by 2050, as the \\nimpact of the large\\n-\\nscale modernisation of thermal power plants is felt.

At the same time the transport sector is expected to \\nbe the fastest growing, albeit from a \\nlow base, exceeding 35 bcm in 2050 with the \\nmajority of consumed volumes stemming from the development of NGV markets. \\n \\nThis report also anticipates a growth in regional gas demand linked to energy industry \\nown needs and use in the pipeline transport syste\\nms, where the bulk of extra volumes \\nwill originate in Russia on the back of the growth of export\\n-\\noriented gas production \\nand the ramp\\n-\\nup of export pipeline supplies.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n25\\n. \\nEurasia natural gas demand by country and sector \\n(bcm)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nIn \\nRussia\\n \\nnatural gas demand will rise by more than 150 bcm over the outlook period. \\nAround 45% of this growth will come from blue hydrogen generation which is in a \\nnascent stage of develo\\npment.

Despite the strong prospect in Russia for pink hydrogen, \\nproduced at electrolysers using nuclear power, blue hydrogen will be the more viable \\noption and will serve as a solid driver for natur\\nal gas to play a large role in the \\n\\n \\nIncremental gas demand is also expected to come from industry, mostly as feedstock \\ngas. In accordance with the Russian Energy Strategy to 2035, which seeks to \\nmaximi\\nze the contribution of the domestic hydrocarbon industry, the development of \\ngas\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nchemical projects will become a priority, boosting the use of gas for methanol, \\nammonia and urea production. In particular, at least eleven new export\\n-\\noriented \\nprojects for\\n \\nmethanol production are in different stages of implementation with a total \\noutput of more than 20 mtpa of methanol. This will significantly strengthen the role of \\nRussia in the global methanol market, while the launch of new plants in the eastern \\npart of \\nthe country will open new export routes, aimed at Asian markets.\\n \\nThe Strategy envisages continued support to expand the use of gas as a fuel for \\nvehicles and the road transport segment is projected to add around 17 bcm over the \\noutlook period. Russia has e\\nstablished all the prerequisites to facilitate the evolution \\nof the NGV market: a well\\n-\\ndeveloped gas distribution network, government support \\nand a broad line\\n-\\nup of gas\\n-\\nfuelled models from domestic manufacturers. Moreover, \\nGazprom has been highly proactive\\n \\nin promoting NGVs and building infrastructure \\nfor refuelling vehicles, including with LNG. In addition, Rosneft and Tatneft are \\ndrawing up plans to retrofit their refuelling stations for CNG and LNG sales (34). As \\nfor gas demand in the residential and com\\nmercial sector, it will rise moderately by \\naround 10 bcm between 2020 and 2050. Despite anticipated progress in the \\ngasification program, stricter efficiency building standards and improving thermal \\ninsulation will be the main factor in restraining a stron\\ng rise in this sector. In this \\ncontext, the potential is forecast to materialize mostly from new connections in \\nEastern Siberia and the Far East of the country.\\n \\nFrom the \\nperspective of the heat and power generation sectors, which are currently \\nthe main \\nconsumers, gas demand in the heat generation sector will experience a \\nstrong decline of 25% to about 77 bcm by 2050 due to technological renovation of \\nexisting CHP plants, switching to efficient gas\\n-\\nfired boilers and improvements in \\ndistrict heating system\\ns. As the power and heat generation sectors are interrelated, \\nthis will affect gas demand growth for electricity supply, simultaneously reinforced by \\nan ongoing governmental programme for the modernization of thermal power plants \\nand the deployment of\\n \\nnew \\nCCGTs. Thus, gas demand in the power generation \\nsector is projected to remain flat at about 115 bcm through to 2050. An additional \\nfactor weighing on gas consumption, despite overall growth in electricity generation, \\nwill be the substantial development of \\nnuclear capacity over the next decades in the \\nwestern part of Russia, where gas\\n-\\nfired power plants are concentrated.\\n \\n \\n148\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nMiddle East \\n \\nNatural gas demand in the Middle East is forecast to grow by 1.6% per annum from \\n505 bcm in 2020 to 805 bcm by 2050. \\nThe rise \\nin consumption will be attributed by \\neconomic and population growth as well as the scope to displace oil products in a \\nrange of sectors, mainly in power generation, while the increase will be largely met \\nby domestic \\nproduction given strategies to exploit t\\n\\nThe bulk of the additional 300 bcm of demand will come from Iran, which will account \\nfor 60% of incremental growth in the region, and to a lesser extent from Saudi Arabia, \\nQatar and Iraq, together responsible for 33%.

In August 2021, Iran announced the discovery of \\na huge new gas deposit, the Chalous structure\\n \\n(estimated to hold gas reserves \\nequivalent to a quarter of the giant South Pars gas field), located in the Caspian Sea, \\nwith a view to forming a new gas hub in northern part of country to complement the \\nsouthern gas hub centred on the South Pars gas field\\n \\n(35). \\nThe \\nincrease in domestic \\ngas consumption will originate also from the fact that Iran has a high level of energy \\nintensity and subsidised fuel prices, which are among the lowest in the world. As a \\nresult, gas will remain the most utilised energy \\ncarrier, increasing from 69% at present \\nto 73% of the energy mix in 2050.\\n \\nThe power generation and industrial sectors will lead the growth, accounting for 47% \\nand 24% of additional gas usage respectively. Overall industrial needs are expected \\nto add 43 bcm\\n \\nthrough to 2050 mainly due to the development of gas\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nchemical \\nand petrochemical facilities as well as light manufacturing. Natural gas is also \\nessential in the residential and commercial sector \\n\\n \\nthis fuel at present amounts to \\n63% of sectoral energy n\\needs and around 95% of the total population are connected \\nto gas grids. The \\ngovernment aims to further enhance gas availability for the growing \\npopulation and expand access to new rural areas. This report forecasts that gas \\ndemand in the residential and co\\nmmercial sector will rise by around 30 bcm to reach \\n90 bcm by 2050.\\n \\nIn the Iranian power system, gas\\n-\\nfired generation \\nwill remain the backbone of \\nelectricity supply. In 2020, natural gas provided 84% of the power generation mix and \\nits share is forecast to\\n \\nslightly narrow to 81% by 2050, maintained by an oil\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas \\nswitching policy. In its turn, currently untapped solar and wind will cover around 15% \\nof the future total electricity generation (projected to almost triple to about 950 TWh \\nin 2050).\\n \\nOverall, g\\nas consumption in this sector is expected to grow from 71 bcm to \\n155 bcm between 2020 and 2050. Close to 30\\n \\nGW of \\ngas\\n-\\nfired capacity is in various \\nstages of completion with a high probability of being commissioned within the coming \\ndecade. By 2050, install\\ned gas\\n-\\nfired capacity in Iran could reach 160 GW (an \\nexpansion of more than 90 GW over the outlook period), representing one of the \\nmajor power markets in the world for gas\\n-\\nfired capacity development.\\n \\nIn \\nSaudi Arabia\\n \\nnatural gas demand is forecast to grow \\nby around 40 bcm, \\napproaching 133 bcm by 2050. High\\n \\ndemographic trends, sustained economic \\ngrowth and policy focus on increased domestic usage of natural gas in industry\\n \\nand \\nin power generation, particularly as a means of substituting oil products and to f\\nree \\nup more oil for export, are the main factors behind the forecast. The scope for oil\\n-\\nto\\n-\\n \\n151\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ngas switching is significant, as this fuel in 2020 constituted 63% of the energy mix \\nand 33% of the power generation mix. To raise gas output, Saudi Arabia plans to \\ninvest in new unconventional shale gas production as well as to develop the Ghawar \\narea, including the Jafarah Basin. \\n \\nThe development of petrochemicals with strong export\\n-\\noriented intentions will remain \\na pillar of the economy. Simultaneously, the country\\n \\nis targeting an allocation of \\nconsiderable gas volumes for blue hydrogen and ammonia generation to supply \\nAsian and European markets. These moves are expected to create additional gas \\nneeds, accounting for more than 90% of the total rise in gas demand in \\nthe country. \\nWithin the power generation sector, gas usage is forecast to increase from 60 bcm in \\n2020 to around 75 bcm by 2040. However by 2050 gas consumption in this sector \\nwill decline to 2020 levels due to the advancement of thermal efficiency of gas\\n-\\nfired \\npower plants and the development of alternative generation sources to fill the void \\nleft by retiring oil\\n-\\nfired capacities.\\n \\nTo reach a less carbon\\n-\\nintensive power generation mix, in 2021 Saudi Arabia \\nlaunched the Saudi Green Initiative, setting a targ\\net of 50% electricity from \\nrenewables \\nby 2030 (36). Prior to this statement, the government had set a target for \\n58.7 GW of renewable capacity by 2030. Along with the renewable deployments, \\nSaudi Arabia has approved a large nuclear programme with 17.6 GW t\\no become \\noperational by the late 2030s (the equivalent of around 16 reactors). This report \\nanticipates a strong intent to pursue renewable projects, including for green hydrogen \\ngeneration. Nevertheless such an amount of capacity will require a significant\\n \\neffort \\nat the network level to adapt to the new generation mix, given such a short 10\\n-\\nyear \\nlead time. By 2050 electricity generation is projected to reach 800 TWh (compared to \\n340 TWh in 2020) with renewables, which will have significant room to ramp up, \\ncovering 48% of electricity supply, while nuclear (assuming partial implementation of \\n14.3\\n \\n\\nwill drop to 4% and natural gas, which currently holds a 66% share, will decline to \\n35% by 2050.\\n \\nIn the \\nUAE,\\n \\nnatural gas demand will decline \\nby around 8 bcm to 60 bcm in 2050 \\nmainly due to the diversification of the power generation mix via the adoption of \\nrenewables and nuclear to fuel electricity demand growth as part of efforts to \\nachieve \\ncarbon neutrality (announced in October 2021). Gas\\n-\\nfired generation in 2020 \\naccounted for 97% of electricity supply, but with a 3\\n-\\nfold increase in power generation \\nto over 450 TWh by 2050, natural gas is forecast to provide less than 30% of \\nelectri\\ncity by that date. This will see a drop in gas demand in the power generation\\n \\nsector from 35 bcm to 22 bcm.\\n \\nFour APR\\n-\\n1400 reactors at the Barakah nuclear power station will come online \\nprogressively (the second reactor was connected to the grid in August 2\\n021 after the \\nfirst reactor had started commercial operations in April 2021), while 4 units of the 2.4 \\n \\n152\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nGW Hassyan clean coal power\\n \\nplant are scheduled to \\noperate at full capacity in 2023. \\nTaking into account that the \\nUAE has one of the lowest costs worldwi\\nde of PVs, this \\nreport projects a very promising long\\n-\\nterm outlook for solar development. According \\nto estimations, solar will account for 60% of the future generation mix, while solar \\ncapacity in 2050 will total 138 GW (compared to less than 3 GW in 2020)\\n, which will \\nbe also used to generate green hydrogen.\\n \\nThe UAE, alongside with Saudi Arabia, is striving to become one of the leading \\nexporters for hydrogen and its derivatives in the region, including based on natural \\ngas feedstocks. For example, ADNOC int\\nends to increase hydrogen production in its \\ndownstream facilities from the current 0.3 mtpa per year to more than 0.5 mtpa in the \\ncoming years and to progress new growth opportunities, particularly in blue ammonia. \\nIn August 2021 the company delivered thre\\ne cargos of blue ammonia to customers \\nin Japan, while earlier in May 2021 ADNOC announced plans to build a plant in \\nRuwais, which will have a capacity of 1 mpta blue ammonia production by 2025 (37). \\nIt is worth adding that ADNOC and two government investme\\nnt funds \\n\\n \\nMubadala \\nand ADQ \\n\\n \\nformed the Abu Dhabi Hydrogen Alliance to position Abu Dhabi as a key \\nsupplier of low\\n-\\ncarbon green and blue hydrogen as well as \\nto accelerate\\n \\n\\nadoption of hydrogen use in major sectors (38). These steps are assumed to\\n \\nprovide \\nupside potential for natural gas demand for blue hydrogen generation that will partially \\ncompensate for decline in the power generation sector.\\n \\nEurope\\n \\nNatural gas demand in Europe totalled 510 bcm in 2020 and accounted for 24% of \\n\\nnergy mix. Shaped by decarbonisation ambitions to achieve climate \\n\\ntarget to cut GHG emissions to 55% by 2030 (versus 1990 levels) in line with the Fit \\nfor 55 package (releas\\ned in July 2021), natural gas demand in the region is projected \\nto drop to 420 bcm by 2050, contributing to 21% of the energy mix. Nevertheless, at \\nleast up until 2030, natural gas demand will remain resilient as emission\\n-\\nreduction \\naims are expected to hav\\ne more impact on coal and oil within the power generation \\nand transport sectors.\\n \\nOver the long\\n-\\nterm, increased pressure from decarbonisation efforts through energy \\n\\npressu\\nre on natural gas, while coal\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas switching dynamics will be largely played \\nout in the latter half of the 2020s. Moreover, low\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen, particularly green \\nhydrogen which is gathering political support, will be introduced for a wide range of \\nacti\\nvities, displacing natural gas, as this fuel will become increasingly available as the \\nhydrogen grid expands. Countries in the region such as Germany, France, Spain and \\nItaly have established production targets, funding allocations and end\\n-\\nuse sectors \\nand \\nare expected to become eventually importers of hydrogen.\\n \\n \\n153\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nGas\\n-\\nbased hydrogen paired with CCS/CCUS will also play a role, offering the best \\ngrowth potential for natural gas usage and will partially compensate for falls in other \\nsectors, and this trend is con\\nsistent with the wider objectives of developing the \\nhydrogen economy in Europe. However, blue hydrogen generation is projected to \\nadvance in a limited number of countries, namely those which have access to \\noffshore storage. The transport sector will repres\\nent an additional area for natural gas \\nexpansion, contributing to emission reductions by displacing oil\\n-\\nbased fuels both in \\nroad and marine segments.\\n \\nIn the power generation sector, the need for gas\\n-\\nfired generation is expected to rise \\nover the coming deca\\nde, resulting in a growth of consumption of up to 140 bcm by \\n2030 (compared to 125 bcm in 2020). Power supply from gas will benefit from \\nongoing coal\\n-\\n\\nnuclear fleet. Moreover, higher carbon\\n \\nprices will make coal increasingly \\nuncompetitive. By 2030, coal is expected to be withdrawn in all major Northwest and \\n\\nintends to retire coal\\n-\\nfired plants by 2022, the UK \\n\\n \\nb\\ny 2024, Italy \\n\\n \\nby 2025 and the \\nNetherlands and Portugal \\n\\n \\nby 2030. Germany will be the sole exception, planning to \\nreduce its coal\\n-\\nfired fleet from 49 GW in 2020 to 17 GW by 2030 with the final \\ndecommission deadline scheduled by 2038, although regular rev\\niews could \\naccelerate closures. In this context, a massive commissioning of gas\\n-\\nfired power \\nplants is anticipated in Germany in order to compensate for coal capacities taken off \\nthe grid. With regard to nuclear power, Germany (by 2022), Belgium (by 2025), \\nand \\nSpain (by 2035) are committed to stopping the operation of their nuclear plants. \\nFrance intends to close 14 out of 58 reactors in the country by 2035.\\n \\nIn addition, countries in Central and Eastern Europe with a relatively high share of \\ncoal in their po\\nwer generation mix (e.g. Poland \\n\\n \\n68%, Czech Republic \\n\\n \\n40%, \\nBulgaria \\n\\n \\n34%, and Romania \\n\\n \\n16%) are expected to follow the example of their \\ncoal\\n-\\nfree neighbours, while considering natural gas as a transition fuel to bridge the \\ntechnology gap. For example, \\nPoland plans to gradually decommission the 5.1\\n \\nGW \\n\\n-\\nfired power plant, which at present generates around 17\\n \\n% of \\n\\nand Resilience Plan, is committed to go co\\nal\\n-\\nfree by 2032, while by 2026 the country \\nis expected to have converted 1.3\\n \\nGW of coal\\n-\\nfired power capacity to natural gas \\n(40). Conversely, Turkey will be the only market where coal\\n-\\nfired capacity will develop \\ndue to its diversification policy, but secto\\nral gas consumption in this country will still \\nincrease strongly, underpinned by rising gas imports and new discoveries.\\n \\nNevertheless, demand for natural gas in the power generation sector in Europe is \\nforecast to fall to around 110 bcm by 2050. Major cons\\numers in this sector, such as \\nGermany, the UK, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands will experience the largest falls in \\ngas usage. Waning potential benefits of fuel switching, a lower utilization rate of gas\\n-\\nfired plants and an assertive build\\n-\\nup of renewable\\ns will weigh on gas demand. In \\n \\n154\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nthis regard, gas will lose market share in the regional power generation mix from 19% \\nin 2020 to 11% in 2050, but gas\\n-\\nfired generation will still be required to provide \\nessential support, contributing to long\\n-\\nterm electricity\\n \\ngrowth as well as to the stability \\nand security of power supply on the back of increasing deployment of variable solar \\nand wind capacities. In the coming three decades, installed gas\\n-\\nfired power capacity \\nin the region is forecast to expand by some 60\\n \\nGW t\\no reach 300 GW by 2050, while \\ncoal and nuclear are expected to drop from 181\\n \\nGW and 123\\n \\nGW in 2020 to 36\\n \\nGW \\nand 75\\n \\nGW by 2050, respectively.\\n \\nRenewables\\n-\\nbased capacity is set to be scaled up massively from 367\\n \\nGW to \\n1,835\\n \\nGW by 2050, to account for 66% of p\\nower generation mix, and this expansion \\nwill also be driven by electricity requirements for green hydrogen production. In its \\nturn, hydrogen in the power system will play a limited\\n \\nrole for seasonal flexibility. \\nLarge amounts of flexibility will be ensured\\n \\nby additional capacity from hydro to \\nCCGTs and batteries, while an integrated electricity network will be able to transmit \\ngeneration over multiple time zones in the region.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n28\\n. \\nEurope power generation by fuel (TWh) \\nand fuel shares (%)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nNote: Others include oil, bioenergy and hydrogen\\n \\nThe residential and \\ncommercial sector is the single largest consumer of natural gas \\nin Europe, accounting for 38% of the \\n\\ndecarbonising this sector will result\\n \\nin lower demand. Through to 2030 demand will \\nlikely remain flat, as gas benefits from fuel switching in countries that still have a large \\nnumber of oil\\n-\\nfired boilers, includin\\ng, among others, Germany, France, the UK and \\nSpain. However, in the long\\n-\\nterm, the overall declining trend will be attributed to \\nenergy efficiency gains in dwellings and commercial floor spaces as well as an \\n0\\n1000\\n2000\\n3000\\n4000\\n5000\\n6000\\n7000\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nOthers\\nRenewables\\nHydro\\nNuclear\\nCoal\\nNatural gas\\n0%\\n20%\\n40%\\n60%\\n80%\\n100%\\n2020\\n2050\\n \\n155\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nincrease in the electrification of space heating\\n, particularly the expansion of electric \\nheat pumps. Other major factors affecting the level of gas demand will be the \\npenetration of alternative heating options, such as hydrogen, biomethane and \\nrenewables at the expense of natural gas due to policy chang\\nes.\\n \\nAs a result, the role of gas in the \\nresidential and commercial sector will come under \\nsevere pressure. Demand will fall by 55% from 196 bcm in 2020 to less than 90 bcm \\nby 2050 with the overall drop in gas usage accelerating after 2030 as the \\ndecarbonis\\ning trend gathers pace. Accordingly, the share of gas in the total sectoral \\nneeds in energy will shrink from 32% to 15% over the forecast period. Germany, the \\nUK, France, Italy and the Netherlands will see the largest decline through to 2050. In \\ncontrast, \\nTurkey, which is actively developing its gas distribution network, is expected \\nto be the only country in the region with rising residential and commercial demand.\\n \\nAdditionally, in the industrial sector, natural gas is getting squeezed by the ongoing \\nelectr\\nification of the economy and orientation towards direct use of hydrogen in \\nenergy\\n-\\nintensive industries. Low\\n-\\ncarbon hydrogen will be considered as a solution in \\nthe most difficult\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ndecarbonise sub\\n-\\nsectors, but natural gas will also face increased \\ncompetit\\nion from electricity for processes with lower\\n-\\nlevel heating needs. In this \\ncontext, the use of natural gas in combination with CCUS will be vital to address \\nfurther GHG mitigation. This report forecasts that gas demand in industry, including \\nusage as a fee\\ndstock, will decline by 53% from 134 bcm in 2020 to 63 bcm in 2050. \\n \\nNevertheless, the loss in gas demand as a heat and steam source will be offset by a \\nrising gas input to generate blue hydrogen both for export supplies and for \\nconsumption in end\\n-\\nuse sect\\nors (including displacement of grey hydrogen), given its \\nlong\\n-\\nterm competitiveness with green hydrogen and synergies with the existing \\nnatural gas infrastructure. Natural gas demand for blue hydrogen generation in \\nEurope is forecast to rise to over 80 bcm \\nby 2050, driven by the UK, the Netherlands \\nand Norway due to geological advantages, namely the ability to store waste CO\\n2\\n \\nin \\ndepleted oil and gas fields as well as in salt caverns. A vivid example is the H2H \\n\\nor, which aims to switch the power \\ngeneration and industrial customers in the Saltend Chemicals Park from natural gas \\n\\n-\\nzero cluster by 2040 (41). \\nCommerciali\\ns\\nation of CCUS and development of a correspo\\nnding full\\n-\\nscale value \\nchain will further support the economics of blue hydrogen. Important early steps are \\n\\nprojects, where CO\\n2 \\nfrom industrial sources will be transported a\\nnd stored beneath \\nthe North Sea.\\n \\nAnother promising avenue for natural gas in Europe will be the transport sector. \\nConsumption will increase from 2 bcm in 2020 to 32 bcm in 2050 driven by LNG \\nusage as a bunker fuel and in heavy\\n \\ngoods vehicles. Around 45% of\\n \\nthis rise\\n \\nwill \\noriginate in marine transport as operators aims to limit sulphur content and reduce \\n \\n156\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nshipping carbon emissions to adapt to IMO requirements. Infrastructure in the region \\nwill support early growth, while rising orders for LNG\\n-\\npowered vessels \\nunderpin high \\n\\nadditional push for natural gas given the existing commercial and technical limitations \\nof alternative fuels.\\n \\nIn road transport, growth potential between 2020 and 20\\n50 accounts for around 17 \\nbcm of demand, with the majority of gas demand in this segment projected to come \\nfrom Italy, Germany, the UK, Poland, Spain, Turkey and Belgium. The increase will \\nbe mostly concentrated in the HGV sub\\n-\\nsegment as a number of haulag\\ne, transport \\nand logistics companies have started to shift their fleet to natural gas. Hydrogen fuel \\ncell trucks are expected to ramp up after 2030s, but natural gas consumption will \\ncontinue to grow due to the scope for displacing diesel in the HGV sub\\n-\\nse\\ngment. The \\npenetration of CNG in the passenger car market will conversely be limited in the \\nregion given an assertive EV and plug\\n-\\nin hybrid cars policy, although a sales ban on \\nnew diesel and petrol cars, switching from LPG and blending natural gas with \\nbi\\nomethane will all ensure upside opportunities.\\n \\nAn important aspect that will support the expansion of NGVs is improving \\ninfrastructure. The European CNG/LNG refuelling network as of November 2021 \\nalready numbers 4,550 stations with almost 460 LNG stations \\nand it covers key \\nhighways in many countries (42). Stringent GHG emission standards together with \\nthe development of refuelling infrastructure and promotion programmes will continue \\nto accelerate the use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n29\\n. \\nEurope natural gas demand by country and sector (bcm)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\n0\\n50\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n250\\n300\\n350\\n400\\n450\\n500\\n550\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nOther Europe\\nBelgium\\nPoland\\nNorway\\nNetherlands\\nSpain\\nFrance\\nItaly\\nTurkey\\nUK\\nGermany\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nOther uses\\nHeat\\ngeneration\\nPower\\ngeneration\\nTransport\\nBlue Hydrogen\\nIndustry\\nRes&Com\\n \\n157\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFrom a country perspective, in 2020 the nine largest consumers (Germany, the UK, \\nItaly, Turkey, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland and Belgium) were responsible \\nfor about 80% of total gas demand in the region. Falling demand in the region will \\ncome fro\\nm the most mature gas markets in Northwest and Southern Europe, while \\nTurkey will be the only country to experience strong growth, from 45 bcm in 2020 to \\nabout 85 bcm in 2050. Ascending trends will be also observed in the UK and \\nspecifically in Norway but \\nonly post\\n-\\n2030, thanks to developments in blue hydrogen \\nproduction.\\n \\nDemand in Central and Eastern Europe is expected to peak in the 2030s, \\nwith Poland and Romania seeing the most notable increase and then go into gradual \\ndecline thereafter.\\n \\nAfrica\\n \\nAfrica i\\ns forecast to have the fastest growth rate of 3.2% per annum, with overall \\ndemand rising from 155 bcm in 2020 to 395 bcm by 2050. The key drivers will be an \\nupbeat outlook for indigenous resource production, a strong increase in electricity \\ndemand, populat\\nion growth and continued industrialization. Egypt and Nigeria will be \\nthe countries where gas makes the most significant in\\n-\\nroads, contributing nearly 55% \\nto regional gas demand growth through to 2050. Expansion of infrastructure could be \\na potential obsta\\ncle in the region, but a number of countries, both established gas \\nproducers and emerging ones with significant resource potential (Mozambique, \\nTanzania, Senegal and Mauritania to name a few) have plans for pipeline \\nconstruction and network development in \\na bid to stimulate local consumption, \\ndespite the strong export orientation of the projects.\\n \\nFrom a sectoral perspective, power generation will provide the bulk of the increase in \\ngas demand, accounting for almost 180 bcm or around 75% of additional volume\\ns in \\nthe region. Natural gas will be the preferred fuel to displace oil\\n-\\nfired power generation, \\nconstrain the expansion of coal\\n-\\nfired capacity (particularly in South Africa and its \\nneighbours, where coal is the dominant fuel source) and enable accelerated \\nelectrification in order to meet the substantial power deficit, especially in sub\\n-\\nSaharan \\ncountries. Moreover, this fuel is considered as a suitable partner for renewables, \\n\\nng \\nprogrammes and initiatives. Natural gas will also play an increasingly important role \\nin sub\\n-\\nSaharan countries that continue to depend on hydropower, ensuring a back\\n-\\nup during dry spells.\\n \\nElectricity \\ngeneration in the region will surge almost four\\n-\\nfold,\\n \\nfrom 850 TWh in 2020 \\nto 3,130 TWh in 2050, mostly driven by increasing requirements in Egypt, Nigeria \\nand South Africa, as well as countries in Eastern and Western Africa. Natural gas is \\nexpected to cover 38% of the total rise in electricity generation be\\ntween 2020 and \\n2050 and provide a stable 38\\n-\\n39% share of the power generation mix. Nigeria and \\nEgypt will be the largest contributors\\n \\nto this trend, as these countries have the \\nstrongest intentions to expand their gas\\n-\\nfired fleet. Simultaneously, options s\\nuch as \\n \\n158\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\ngas\\n-\\nby\\n-\\nwire within the same regional power pool and the development of LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower projects will create additional sources of demand allowing African nations to \\nmonetize locally produced gas and intensify intra\\n-\\nregion integration.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n30\\n.

In the residential \\nand commercial sector, demand will increase by 18 bcm over the forecast period with \\nthe majority of the growth coming from North Af\\nrican countries amid the development \\nof transmission and distributions networks and an increasing number of citizens \\nconnected to the grid. Nevertheless, there is a potential for natural gas to penetrate \\nthe residential segment of sub\\n-\\nSaharan countries, pa\\nrticularly for cooking, where \\nsolid biomass is projected to stay high and remain the primary source of energy, \\naccounting for more than 60% of household needs in 2050. Road transport will \\nemerge as a significantly new area of gas demand expansion in the re\\ngion with Egypt \\nand Nigeria being the main growth centres, supported by the rolling out of vehicle \\nconversion programs to switch to CNG and refuelling station construction.\\n \\nThe position of gas varies significantly across the continent as does the contribut\\nion \\nof sub\\n-\\nregions to total demand growth.

In \\nAlgeria\\n, currently the second\\n-\\nlargest and already mature gas market in the region, demand is expected to inc\\nrease \\nmoderately, adding about 6 bcm over the outlook period. This is due to the intensified \\ndevelopment of renewables, particularly solar, and integration of efficient CCGTs, \\noffsetting growing gas usage in the residential segment and for blue hydrogen \\nge\\nneration. \\nEgypt\\n \\nwill add around 55 bcm through to 2050 and this growth will come \\nprimarily from surging electricity requirements and the associated expansion of the \\ngas\\n-\\nfired power fleet as well as rising demand in industry, road transport and \\nresidential \\n\\nsubstitute for oil products, while the ramp\\n-\\nup of production from existing fields and \\nnew discoveries will feed increasing domestic gas demand. In \\nMorocco\\n, gas \\nconsumption is projecte\\nd to rise by 5 bcm, mostly for industrial needs and to gradually \\nreplace coal\\n-\\nfired generation, in line with the National Roadmap for Natural Gas \\nDevelopment, published in August 2021 (43).\\n \\nSub\\n-\\nSaharan African gas consumption will rise from 35 bcm in 2020 \\nto 205 bcm in \\n2050, amounting to 71% of the total regional increase. This trend will be \\noverwhelmingly driven by the ramp\\n-\\nup in gas\\n-\\nfired generation, industrial activity and \\na growing demand for energy sector\\n-\\nrelated needs mostly due to the development of \\nLNG export facilities. The power generation sector will lead the increase, contributing \\nto more than 130 bcm over the forecast period, as almost 105 GW of new gas\\n-\\nfired \\ncapacity will be commissioned. More than 90% of this expansion in capacity will occur \\n0\\n50\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n250\\n300\\n350\\n400\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nOther sub-\\nSaharan Africa\\nOther North\\nAfrica\\nSouth Africa\\nAlgeria\\nNigeria\\nEgypt\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nOther uses\\nPower\\ngeneration\\nTransport\\nBlue\\nhydrogen\\nIndustry\\nRes&Com\\n \\n160\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\ni\\nn Western and Southern Africa\\nn\\n \\ncountries, where Nigeria and South Africa together \\nwill be responsible for around 65% of the growth. It is forecast that electricity \\ngeneration in sub\\n-\\nSaharan Africa\\n \\nwill rise from 490 TWh in 2020 to 1,710 TWh by \\n2050 and gas\\n-\\nfired generation will play a leading role, providing 40% of electricity \\nsupply by that date. \\n \\nFrom country perspective in sub\\n-\\nSaharan Africa, \\nNigeria\\n \\nis projected to add the most \\ndemand \\n\\n \\nmore than 75 bcm between 2020 and 2050. A recently adopted policy \\nd\\nirected at expanding the local use of large gas resources, such as the rollout of the \\nNational Gas Expansion Program and the implementation of a Nigerian Gas \\nTransportation Network Code, will be pillars for the gas\\n-\\nbased transition for the \\nNigerian economy\\n. The country is developing the Ajaokute\\n-\\nKaduna\\n-\\nKano pipeline \\nand other infrastructure capable of enhancing supplies to industrial sites, power \\nplants and encouraging the monetisation of gas that is currently flared. \\nSouth Africa\\n \\nis forecast to increase ga\\ns demand by over 25 bcm. Gas\\n-\\nfired power projects will \\nsignificantly contribute to the future power generation mix, helping to shift away from \\nextensive coal use (at present coal accounts for 85% of the electricity generated) and \\nLNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower projects will\\n \\nbe an attractive option. For example, in September 2021 \\n\\nto provide a combined 1,220 MW of power capacity via three gas\\n-\\nfired floating power \\nplants moored for 20 years in t\\nhe ports of Richards Bay, Coega and Saldanha Bay \\n(44).\\n \\nLatin America\\n \\nNatural gas demand in Latin America is projected to increase by 2.4% per annum, \\nfrom 155 bcm in 2020 to 315 bcm in 2050. Over the next three decades primary \\nenergy demand in the region wi\\nll rise by more than 60% and natural gas will make \\nthe most significant in\\n-\\nroads, being a major component in building more a sustainable \\nenergy system. The share of gas in the regional energy mix is forecast to grow from \\n21% to 27% over the outlook period.\\n \\nThe rise in consumption is attributed to a post\\n-\\npandemic economic recovery, population growth and government policies to promote \\nthis fuel in the power generation sector, for industrial applications and in road \\ntransport. The growth in indigenous producti\\non, particularly in Argentina, Brazil and \\nVenezuela will boost availability, although a lack of pipeline interconnections and \\ninsufficient investment for the expansion of infrastructure could be limiting factors for \\nfully\\n-\\nfledged integration in the region.\\n \\nLNG imports will remain a relevant option to \\n\\n \\nThe power generation sector will be a driving force, contributing around 80 bcm or \\n50% of additional gas usage in the region. The expa\\nnsion in demand is explained by \\nthe transition from fuel oil and an overdependence on hydro towards more diversified \\npower supplies. The development of gas\\n-\\nfired generation, including primarily LNG\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npower projects, and progressive solar and wind capacity\\n \\nadditions will be \\n \\n161\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nprioritised. Thus, with growing electricity generation and the need to complement \\nintermittent renewables, the share of natural gas in the regional power generation mix \\nwill rise from 17% to 19% between 2020 and 2050 (peaking in 2040\\n-\\n204\\n3 with a 21% \\nshare). Nevertheless, gas demand in the power generation sector will continue to be \\ncharacterized by some volatility, increasing in dry seasons and declining during wet \\nperiods, given the critical role that hydro plays.\\n \\nFigure 3.\\n32\\n. \\nLatin America power generation by fuel (TWh) and fuel shares (%)\\n \\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nNote: Others include coal, nuclear and hydrogen\\n \\nAs for other sectors, a major portion of the increase in gas demand is projected to \\ncome from industry which will see a \\nrise of 37 bcm over the outlook period. \\nConsumption in road transport will grow by nearly 14 bcm through to 2050, driven by \\nenvironmenta\\nl policies and price advantages over diesel\\n \\nand gasoline.

However, \\nthe \\n\\nsh\\nare \\nof the \\nglobal natural gas supply will reduce from 1\\n6\\n% in 2020 to 15% in \\n2050. This is primarily due to \\na\\n \\nmore significant expansion in other regions and a slower \\nincrease in Asia\\n \\nPacific production in the period \\nbetween\\n \\n2040 \\nand\\n \\n2050 due to \\ngas \\nreserves \\nconstraint.

We expect that total gas production from current GECF members will increase by more \\nthan half, reaching approximately 2\\n,\\n600 bcm by 2050. This translates to a 1.4% annual growth \\nrate over the outlook period, which will enable the GECF to\\n \\nkeep its share of global gas \\nproduction at more than 46.5%.\\n \\n \\n \\n166\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n4.1 Global natural gas production outlook \\n \\nMaintaining and expanding demand is the main driver for the supply of any fuel, and \\nnatural gas is no exception. The economic utilisation of natural g\\nas in many sectors \\nsuch as industry, power and construction will sustain its role in becoming the dominant \\nfossil fuel in the entire energy system through to 2050. Other significant drivers will pave \\nthe way for natural gas to maintain its position. Its po\\nsition as the cleanest natural fossil \\nfuel coupled with other measures to reduce its carbon footprint\\ns\\n, such as CCUS and \\nmethane leakage abatement technologies, are creating the policy support which will \\nenhance the role of natural gas. Hydrogen, a promisi\\nng fuel for the future energy mix, \\nis another expected development in the energy sector in which natural gas is assumed \\nto play a role. Blue hydrogen is a very economical fuel and a solution for decarbonising \\nhard\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nabate sectors, while simultaneously bei\\nng a pathway to decarbonise the \\nabundant resources of natural gas. \\n \\nApart from the expansion in natural gas demand which is the main stimulus for natural \\ngas production, the \\neconomic \\nbenefits\\n \\nof natural gas, technological enhancements and \\nresource readiness\\n \\nare also among the main drivers in global natural gas production. \\nAdvances in offshore deep\\n-\\nwater production, unconventional production with a lower \\ncarbon footprint and economical extracti\\non of remote reserves will maintain the level of \\nextractable resources and consequently increase the level of available gas. \\n \\nIn terms of offshore production, it is forecast that around 4\\n3\\n% of total natural gas \\nproduction will be sourced from offshore rese\\nrves by 2050 compared to the current \\nshare of almost \\n29\\n%. This edition of the \\nGECF GGO \\nforecasts that\\n \\nproduction \\nfrom \\ndeep\\n-\\nwater field\\ns\\n \\nwill contribute \\nalmost\\n \\none\\n \\ntcm\\n \\nof annual output \\nby 2050\\n, an almost \\nfivefold increase from current levels. Accordingly, t\\nhe share of deep\\n-\\nwater production \\nwill reach almost 17% by the Outlook horizon compared with the current share of 6%. \\nIn particular, India and Indonesia are expected to source the bulk of their expansion in \\nnatural gas production from deep\\n-\\nwater fields. De\\nep\\n-\\nwater production is also \\nresponsible for the upbeat forecast in natural gas production in Mozambique.\\n \\nProduction from the arctic area is also forecast to continue with the bulk of production \\ncoming from Russian arctic regions. According to the modelling\\n \\nanalysis results for this \\nOutlook, in the 2040s\\n,\\n \\nmore than 600 bcm of natural gas will be extracted annually by \\nRussia from its arctic area. Unconventional natural gas production in \\nthe \\nReference \\nCase Scenario is also forecast to be strong, m\\nain\\nly as a re\\nsult of shale gas production \\nthat will be discussed further \\nin the document\\n. \\n \\nAdvancement in technologies to abate methane emissions, the most critical drawback \\nof natural gas, as well as improvements in CCUS through growth in economies of scale \\nand the in\\ntroduction of cleaner pathways for natural gas use (such as blue hydrogen), \\nwill maintain the role of natural gas by 2050. However, with emerging zero\\n-\\ncarbon \\npolicies and pledges for carbon neutrality, the demand for natural gas and, \\nconsequently, its prod\\nuction is forecast to some extent lower in this edition of the \\nOutlook compared with the previous one.\\n \\n \\n167\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFigure 4.\\n1\\n. \\nOutlook for g\\nlobal natural gas production (bcm)\\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF \\nGGM\\n \\nThis \\nreport forecasts that g\\nlobal natural gas production will continue to rise by an \\na\\nverage annual growth rate of 1.2\\n% from \\naround \\n3\\n8\\n4\\n0\\n \\nbcm in 20\\n20\\n \\nto \\n56\\n25\\n \\nbcm in \\n2050. \\nThe Middle East will contribute the largest share of the growth, accounting for \\nalmost 32% \\nof the total change, followed by Eurasia, North America and \\nAfrica. \\nSimilar \\nto the previous edition of the Outlook, \\nEurope \\nis the\\n \\nonly\\n \\nregion \\nto record a negative \\ncontribution to the global gas growth amounting to 7%\\n \\n(1)\\n.\\n \\nFigure 4.\\n2\\n. \\nRegional share in g\\nlobal natural gas production (bcm)\\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF \\nGGM\\n \\n0\\n1000\\n2000\\n3000\\n4000\\n5000\\n6000\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nAfrica\\nAsia Pacific\\nEurasia\\nEurope\\nLatin America\\nMiddle East\\nNorth America\\nReference case 2020\\n6%\\n16%\\n22%\\n5%\\n4%\\n17%\\n30%\\n9%\\n15%\\n24%\\n1%\\n4%\\n21%\\n26%\\nAfrica\\nAsia Pacific\\nEurasia\\nEurope\\nLatin America\\nMiddle East\\nNorth America\\n2020\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\n168\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n4.2 Regional natural gas production outlook\\n \\nAfrica\\n \\nNatural gas is Africa\\n\\ns greatest \\nopportunity\\n, not just as a \\ntransition fuel to a green \\neconomy but also as a long\\n-\\nterm\\n \\nsolution for\\n \\nenergy supply.\\n \\nThe continent is \\nthe fastest\\n-\\ngrowing region \\nfor\\n \\nnatural gas production\\n \\nas, since 2020\\n, \\nAfrica has stepped up \\nexploration activities despite a global downturn in oil and \\ngas production and investment. \\nMuch\\n \\nof this \\nexpansion\\n \\noriginates from production developments \\nfor LNG exports \\nin \\nthree projects in \\nMozambique and \\nNigeria\\n\\n \\nLNG (NLNG) Train 7 project\\n, as well as\\n \\nthe \\njoint offshore \\ndevelopment in Mauritania and Senegal, in \\naddition \\nto production from\\n \\nNorth African countries such as Algeria and Egypt to support \\ntheir \\ndomestic market \\ngrowth.\\n \\nIn Angola, which holds an estimated \\n350\\n \\nb\\nc\\nm\\n \\nprove\\nn\\n \\nnatural gas reserves, most \\nproduction \\nis not marketed.

Overall, China will be the source of more than \\n85% of t\\notal unconventional production and be responsible for almost half of the entire \\noutput in Asia Pacific by 2050.\\n \\nAccording to modelling results based on the quantity of reserves and their signature \\nprofiles, most of this expansion will take place up until 2\\n040, after which a slight \\nreduction or stable production level is seen in most countries in the region. \\n \\nThis report expects that gas production in Asia\\n \\nPacific will expand by 22% to reach \\naround 815 bcm by 2050. However\\n,\\n \\nthe \\n\\nshare of the global n\\natural gas supply \\nwill reduce from 1\\n6\\n% in 2020 to 15% in 2050\\n. This result \\nis \\nprimari\\nly due to \\na\\n \\nmore \\nsignificant expansion in other regions a\\nnd\\n \\nonly a \\nmild increase in Asia\\n \\nPacific \\nproduction \\nin \\nthe \\nperiod from 2040 to 2050 due to the reserves constraint.\\n \\n \\nAustralia\\n \\n\\nreserves are the second largest in \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nregion, behind China. Natural gas \\nproduction in the country has doubled since 2015, driven by a rapid expansion o\\nf the \\nLNG industry on its western and eastern coasts. Last year, the country produced about \\n153 bcm of gas, of which around 40 bcm was produced from unconventional coal seam \\ngas resources.\\n \\nRegarding the latest major gas discoveries in Australia, last Septe\\nmber a joint venture \\nbetween Energy Resources of Australia Limited and Norwest Energy NL Perth Basin \\nmade a conventional gas discovery in the Lockyer Deep\\n-\\n1 wildcat onshore North Perth \\nbasin in Western Australia. The early assessment of gas resources withi\\nn the area is \\nestimated to be more than 31 bcm, and production could begin by 2030. \\n \\nFurthermore, Senex Energy has reached FID for a USD 29 mn expansion of its Atlas \\n\\nincre\\nasing natural gas production by 50%, from the current 330 mcm/y to more than 500 \\nmcm/y. The project is expected to be commissioned in 1Q 2023 and is estimated to \\nproduce more than 1.6 bcm of gas by the end of 2025.\\n \\nAdditionally, Santos has taken an FID on \\nthe USD 3.6 bn Barossa project. The Barossa \\nproject will see the development of the Barossa gas and condensate field in the Timor \\n\\nwill connect to the Darwin LNG pipe\\nline. First gas from the Barossa project is expected \\nto come onstream by mid\\n-\\n2025.\\n \\nAustralia is also a pioneer in hydrogen production. Woodside plans to develop a \\nhydrogen and ammonia project in Perth, dubbed as H2Perth, with an investment of more \\nthan USD 750 mn for the first phase. H2Perth will produce up to 1,500 t/d of hydrogen \\nfor e\\nxport in the form of ammonia and liquid hydrogen. These will be produced by \\n \\n175\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nemploying natural gas reforming, alongside electrolysis technology. The initial phase of \\nsteam methane reforming at the project will use about 3.1 mcm/d of natural gas. \\nLikewise, S\\nantos is also looking into the possibility of boosting its blue hydrogen \\nproduction in the Cooper Basin.\\n \\nOver the outlook period, Australian natural gas production is forecast to remain \\nstagnant, amounting to around 150 bcm. It is expected that around one\\n-\\nthird of the \\nproduction will be sourced from YTF resources. Unconventional production will \\ncomprise an additional share of 18% or about 28 bcm of total Australian gas production. \\nThe rest (and majority) of production by 2050 will be supplied by new project\\ns, totalling \\n64 bcm.\\n \\nIndia\\n \\nA\\n \\nfundamental change in gas supply occurred in the country following the adoption of a \\npolicy in 2016 to support upstream activities\\n.\\n \\nAs part of the policy, India aims to enhance \\nthe share of natural gas in its national energy picture, and local production is the priority \\npathway to contribute to this target. \\n \\nIn 2020, the Indian government declared a plan to expand the gas grid by 66% \\nto ease \\naccess to natural gas and to achieve a share of 15% for natural gas in the national \\nenergy mix by 2030.\\n \\nAs a result of \\nthe \\npolicy change, companies \\nhave \\nreceived more pricing freedom \\nas they \\nhave been able \\nto market natural gas at higher prices \\nacr\\noss\\n \\nall sectors. \\nThis was in \\nline with government policies to open the gas market and enhance the natural gas \\nindustry to achieve an appropriate level of competitiveness. \\n \\nSuch \\nregulatory reforms have attracted private investment in deep\\n-\\nwater \\nreserves \\nand\\n \\ncoalbed\\n \\nmethane\\n. Companies have invested hugely in exploratio\\nn and production, and \\nm\\nost of these investments have \\ntaken place\\n \\nin challenging natural gas fields such as \\nunconventional and offshore\\n,\\n \\ndeep\\n-\\nwater reserves.\\n \\nIn 2020, natural gas production dropp\\ned to around 27 bcm after years of stability of \\naround 30 bcm/yr. However, the start\\n-\\nup of the \\nKG\\n-\\nDWN98/2 block \\nin 2020\\n \\nis expected \\nto \\nhelp production levels recover in the medium term. Additionally, this report predicts a \\nsignificant growth of 85% through\\n \\nto 2030. This massive expansion in almost ten years \\nresults from policy support and investment in upstream offshore oil and gas. The \\nproduction level in 2030 is expected to stand at 50 bcm, of which more than 56% will be \\nsourced from new projects. \\n \\nYTF re\\nsources will be the critical assets to maintain this production through to 2050. \\nI\\nn \\nthe 2030s toward the end of the outlook horizon, YTF resources will play a dominant \\nrole in Indian gas output.\\n \\nIn the \\nlong\\n \\nterm\\n, we see a slight increase in output between 2030 and 2050. In this \\nperiod, investment in discovery and exploration will be one of the critical pillars of Indian \\n \\n176\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\ngas development. \\nThese results illustrate \\nthe importance\\n \\nof regulatory change and \\npolicy suppo\\nrt in upstream investment \\nwhich \\nleads \\nto\\n \\ndiscovery projects and results in \\nYTF resource exploration. \\n \\nOur latest analysis and modelling suggest that the volume of marketed natural gas \\nproduction in India will be expanded to around 62 bcm by 2050, of which \\nthree quarters \\nwill be sourced from \\nYTF resources. \\nAround 50 bcm is expected to be sourced from \\ndeep\\n-\\nwater projects which will account for a significant share of 80% of the total volume. \\nThe Krishna\\n-\\nGodavari Basin Phases 1\\n-\\n3 is likely to contribute to almo\\nst half of gas \\noutput by 2050. \\n \\nIndonesia\\n \\n\\nn\\n \\nnatural gas reserves tota\\nl\\n \\nmore than 1300 bcm, the \\nthird\\n-\\nlargest in \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nregion, \\njust behind \\nChina and Australia.\\n \\nLast year, the country produced 63 \\nbcm of gas\\n, mostly from\\n \\nits\\n \\noffshore fields\\n \\nand\\n \\nnot associated with crude oil production. \\n\\nof infrastructure to produce associated natural gas, around 1.8 bcm of natural gas was \\nflared last year, pla\\ncing Indonesia among the top 15 global producers of flared natural \\ngas.\\n \\nDeclining gas\\n \\noutput continues to affect the amount of\\n \\ngas available for export, both by \\npipeline\\n \\nt\\no Malaysia and Singapore and as LNG.\\n \\nThe \\ngovernment \\nis promoting the \\nexploration of n\\natural gas\\n,\\n \\nCBM\\n \\nand shale gas\\n. \\nAlthough \\nthe country has vast CBM resources, production has been lower than \\nexpected due to regulatory and environmental issues\\n.\\n \\n\\nset a crude \\noil and condensates \\nproduction target of \\n705,000 b/d\\n, which includes a plan \\nto \\ndrill 1,000 development wells per year by 2025.

However, Iran and Qatar have seen the most significant level of annual \\noff\\n-\\nshore production (shallow\\n-\\nwater). \\n \\nOutlook for associated gas production\\n \\nAssociated\\n-\\ndissolved natural gas (gas obtained from crude oil reservoirs) has always \\nbee\\nn accounted for as a share of total gas production. This gas can be found as free \\ngas (associated) or in solution with crude oil, referred to as dissolved gas. \\nLike\\n \\nthe \\nimpact that COVID\\n-\\n19 had on non\\n-\\nassociated gas production, the demand for oil also \\ndecl\\nined in 2020, resulting in a lower level of associated gas production in that year. \\nAccording to the EIA, associated gas production in the US fell in 2020 \\nby 1.5% reaching \\na level of around 140 bcm, \\nfollowing three years of growth. For the first time since\\n \\n2016, \\nthe share of associated gas production in the US was reduced to almost 37.7%. \\n \\nA\\ns\\n \\nmentioned in the previous chapter, this report forecasts that the demand for oil will \\nstabilise through to 2050 and the level of global oil production will peak at sli\\nghtly more \\nthan 100 mboe/d in around 2035 and will steady at around 90 mboe/d by 2050. This \\nlower level of crude oil production will consequently affect the level of associated gas \\nproduction. Furthermore, the need for EOR measures by \\nthe \\ninjection of asso\\nciated gas \\nin\\nto\\n \\noil wells will be magnified by the ageing oil reservoirs. So a lower level of associated \\ngas will reach the market, and the total volume of production from this category in the \\nfuture is forecast to be lower than current levels. \\n \\nCurrently,\\n \\nit is estimated that slightly less than 500 bcm of marketed natural gas is \\nsourced from oil wells, and this level excludes the volume of the gas obtained from \\nunconventional crude oil production. The total level of associated gas production is even \\nhigher\\n \\nthan this, as injection and recirculation do not count in marketed production.\\n \\nThis Outlook projects that the level of associated gas will decline to around 400 bcm, \\nwhich will contribute to about 7% of total gas production by 2050 compared with the \\ncurre\\nnt approximate 12%.\\n \\nRussia, Saudi Arabia, the US, Brazil, Nigeria, UAE, Venezuela, Mexico, Indonesia and \\nKazakhstan are among the main contributors to associated gas production. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n195\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFigure 4.\\n12\\n. \\nOutlook for associated and \\nnon\\n-\\nassociated gas production\\n \\n(bcm\\n, %)\\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from\\n \\nthe\\n \\nGECF GGM\\n \\nUnconventional gas production outlook\\n \\nIn recent decades, the advancement in upstream technologies such as horizontal and \\ndirectional drilling, logging while \\ndrilling (LWD) and hydraulic fracturing have positively \\nimpacted the production level of almost all types of unconventional resources. \\n \\nProgress in shale gas extraction, as well as other types of unconventional gas \\nresources, has \\nresult\\ned\\n \\nin a considerable reduction in production costs across the entire \\nproduction chain.

The model first of all fulfils \\nlong\\n-\\nterm contractual obligations, and the rest is al\\nlocated to spot market trades.\\n \\nThe \\nforecasts are based on optimisation using cost curve data for each delivery point\\n, taking \\naccount of both production\\n \\nand \\ntransportation costs.\\n \\nIt contains three subchapters. The first subchapter examines the core current and future \\ntrends of the natural gas trade including the gas trade infrastructure prospects and \\nnatural gas pricing \\nmechanisms. The second subchapter provides a regional projection \\nof\\n \\nthe international gas trade by pipeline and LNG, both contracted and spot\\n \\ntraded. The \\nthird subchapter is devoted to the investment prospects and financing requirements of \\nthe natural gas \\nupstream and midstream.\\n \\n5.1\\n \\nGlobal natural gas trade\\n \\nThe global gas trade is expected to grow by 45% between 2020 and \\n2050 to reach \\n1,815 bcma\\n, around 1/3 of global gas demand. Of that total, LNG will overtake pipeline \\ntrade by 2030 and reach 1\\n,\\n150 bcm\\na\\n \\nby 2050.\\n \\n \\nThe share of \\nAsia Pacific\\n \\nin global LNG trade will rise from 70% in 2020 to 80% by 2050.    \\nAround three\\n-\\nquarters of global LNG trade is tied to oil prices and it is expected that \\nlong\\n-\\nterm oil\\n-\\nindexed contracting will be sustained in the global\\n \\nnatural gas trade.   \\n \\nThe growth in LNG trade is expected to be supported by the ong\\noing ramp\\n-\\nup of new \\nLNG projects. Total liquefaction capacity rose from 271 mtpa in 2010 up to 454 mtpa in \\n2020 and\\n \\nis\\n \\nenvisaged to reach 1,200 mtpa by 2050\\n. \\nRegasificatio\\nn capacity is expected \\nto increase from 947 mtpa in 2020 to almost 1,400 mtpa by 2050, of which over 1,000 \\nmtpa will be in Asia.\\n \\nAs of end\\n-\\n2020, 108 mtpa of liquefaction capacity was under \\nconstruction. Over the forecast period, the highest LNG export capa\\ncity additions are \\nexpected to come from \\nthe \\nUS, Australia, Qatar, Russia and Mozambique. It is forecast \\nthat Russia will overtake\\n \\n\\n-\\nlargest LNG exporter (after Qatar \\nand US) in the late 2030s.\\n \\nWhile Asia will dominate LNG dema\\nnd, the share between Asian countries will change \\nsignificantly over the forecast period. The share of global demand met by the traditional \\nmarkets of Japan, Korea and Taiwan will drop from 39% in 2020 to 18% by 2040. By \\ncontrast, South and Southeast Asia \\nwill increase their share from 14% in 2020 to over \\n\\nlargest LNG importer\\n, and\\n \\nin 2020, China ha\\nd\\n \\nalmost 20% of global LNG imports.  \\n \\n201\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nAccording to GECF forecasts, Indian demand\\n \\nfor LNG \\ncould\\n \\nclimb to 45 mtpa by 2030 \\nand reach 110 mtpa by 2050.\\n \\nThe years \\n2020 and 2021 have seen extreme volatility in crude oil and regional gas \\nbenchmark prices. In April 2020, Brent reached a low point of \\nUSD\\n13/bbl soon followe\\nd \\nby TTF falling belo\\nw \\nUSD \\n1\\n/\\nmmb\\ntu and Asian LNG spot prices (JKM)\\n \\ndropping below \\nUSD \\n2\\n/\\nmmb\\ntu.  At the other extreme, in October 2021, Brent was over \\nUSD \\n80/bbl, \\nTTF \\nreached \\nUSD \\n54\\n/\\nmmb\\ntu\\n \\nand JKM reached \\nUSD \\n50\\n/\\nmmb\\ntu. This volatility has affected \\na broad array of industry \\nstakeholders, and whether the current rebound in spot prices \\nsupports a wave of new LNG investments remains open.\\n \\nWhile LNG has traditionally been traded under long\\n-\\nterm arrangements, the share of \\nspot and short\\n-\\nterm trading has been growing steadily, reac\\nhing a record 40% in 2020.  \\nGECF members fully support the role of long\\n-\\nterm gas contracts as well as gas pricing \\nbased on oil indexation, but the extent to which customers will share this view is less \\nclear. Some legacy buyers in Asia, such as Japan, migh\\nt seek increased flexibility, \\nGECF believes that buyers from China, Pakistan and Bangladesh\\n \\nwill continue to look \\nfor long\\n-\\nterm contracts. There has also been a trend away from point\\n-\\nto\\n-\\npoint trades \\ntowards a greater role for portfolio players and traders.\\n  \\nMajor LNG suppliers and buyers \\nare also in the process of setting up LNG trading and optimisation arms.\\n \\n\\n \\ncarbon \\nfootprint on top of price \\n\\nrease. Carbon \\nemissions can either be reduced or offset with the purchase of nature\\n-\\nbased carbon \\ncredits. Both approaches are leading to more rigorous measurement, verification and \\nreporting of emissions along the LNG value chain.  \\n \\nThe key challenge to fu\\nture growth in natural gas trade (and in particular LNG) comes \\nfrom\\n \\nthe global energy transition. \\nThis may make it more difficult for project developers \\nto lock in long\\n-\\nterm contracts needed to finance the high\\n-\\ncost, capital\\n-\\nintensive, long \\npayback project\\ns.\\n \\nThe high volatility in LNG prices increases uncertainty and is leading \\nto a stronger drive for cost reduction. Many of the largest LNG importers in Europe and \\nAsia have pledged to become carbon neutral \\n\\n \\nin many cases by 2050, and by 2060 \\nand 2070 in th\\ne case of China and India respectively.\\n \\nThe LNG industry must respond \\nby increasing carbon mitigation efforts, including carbon capture and storage, and gas \\nproducers will need to diversify into lower carbon alternatives such as blue hydrogen \\nand ammonia.\\n \\nCurrent developments\\n \\nAs the global economy is cautiously walking away from the shadow of the \\nunprecedented challenge of the COVID\\n-\\n19 pandemic, there is an observed resilience \\n\\n1.\\n \\nCOVID\\n-\\n19\\n\\n \\nimpact on \\nthe \\nLNG trade was severe in 2Q and 3Q 2020, due to massive \\nlockdowns and multiple various disruptions across the globe, but short\\n-\\nlived. Overall, in \\n2020, with the global GDP growth rate and natural gas demand contraction of 3.1% an\\nd \\n \\n202\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n2% respectively, LNG trade has grown to \\na \\nrecord \\nlevel, albeit \\nat the slowest rate of \\n0.4% year\\n-\\non\\n-\\nyear, up by 1.4 MT. Such relatively marginal growth was mostly driven by \\nAsia\\'s holding steady demand, underlying global economic recovery. As for the supp\\nly, \\nit was supported by enhanced exports from the United States and Australia. In the end, \\n2020 turned very successful for the United States\\' LNG exports that have grown by 33% \\ncompared to 2019. Also, LNG was one of the few commodities that witnessed an up\\nturn \\nin trade on the positive side. In essence \\n-\\n \\nin the face of a pandemic in 2020 \\n-\\n \\nLNG trade \\nhas proven resilient, increasingly diverse, and global.\\n \\nIn 2020, global natural gas production and consumption of 3,840 bcma was balanced \\nby inter\\n-\\nregional trade\\n, primarily driven by the key net\\n-\\nimporting regions of \\nAsia Pacific\\n \\nand Europe together with significantly smaller imports flowing to Latin America. The top \\n5 importers \\n\\n \\nChina (141 bcma), Germany (108 bcma), Japan (103 bcma), Italy (66 \\nbcma), Korea (56 bc\\nma) \\n-\\n \\nstood for almost 40% of the global imports in 2020.\\n \\nDue to geographically uneven distribution of natural gas reserves and core production \\ncent\\nre\\ns, the top five natural gas exporters \\n-\\n \\nRussia (238 bcma), the US (142 bcma), \\nQatar (125 bcma), Norway (11\\n1 bcma), Australia (106 bcma) \\n-\\n \\naccounted for over a half \\n(58%) of the market share last year. \\n \\nLNG might be one of the few remaining strong growth opportunities in oil and gas. LNG \\ntrade has been historically showing remarkable development over the past two decades \\nwith over 3.5 times growth, ramping up from 103 MT (141 bcma) in 2000 up to 356 MT \\n(4\\n84 bcma) at the end of 2020. It could more than double over the next three decades. \\n \\nThough the overall LNG market was much more resilient compared with the oil market \\nthrough the course of the COVID\\n-\\n19 pandemic, it showed an increased volatility pattern \\nc\\nombined with a more clearly highlighted seasonality factor. One of the most notable \\nand challenging trends of 2020 and early 2021 was significantly increased volatility in \\ntraded LNG volumes and, more importantly, extreme turbulence in LNG prices in \\ndiffer\\nent regional markets. Late 2020 and early 2021 record six\\n-\\nyear highs in spot prices \\nin Atlantic and Asia Pacific basins replaced the record lows of early 2020\\n \\nin \\na \\nblink of \\nan eye. \\n \\nLong\\n-\\nterm Outlook\\n \\nThe Outlook remains positive about the prospects of \\nlong\\n-\\nterm natural gas demand and \\ntrade growth. The global gas trade is expected to grow by 45% by 2050, at an average \\ngrowth rate of 1.5% per annum between 2020 and 2050 from 1,255 bcma in 2020 to \\nreach 1,815 bcm, accounting for 1/3 of global gas demand. F\\nor the past 30 years, since \\n1990, natural gas trade has grown by an average annual growth rate of 5.1% due to \\npipeline trade development at an early stage (average annual growth of 8.3% in 1990 \\n\\n \\n2000) with the more rapid growth of LNG trade at a later sta\\nge (average annual growth \\nof 8.2% in 2000 \\n\\n \\n2010).\\n \\n \\n203\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFigure 5.\\n1\\n. \\nGlobal natural gas trade by flow type (bcm)\\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nWhile only 24% of all the natural gas traded worldwide consist\\ned of LNG in 1990, it had \\nincreased to 40% in 2020. LNG trade is estimated to surpass the pipeline trade by 2030 \\nat 50% share (700 bcma) and to account for 60% (1,090 bcma) of global gas trade by \\n2050. \\n \\nThe evolving scale and geographic scope of LNG trade will lead to a greater global gas \\nsupply security. By 2050, according to the GECF Global Gas Outlook forecasts, it is \\nexpected that the total number of LNG exporters will reach over 30 countries, while \\na\\nround 50 countries will be importing LNG. By the end of 2020, 20 countries were \\nexporting their natural gas as LNG, a significant increase from only 13 in 2005. In the \\nlast 15 years, an increasingly improved access to LNG was evident as the number of \\nLNG i\\nmporting countries has shown an impressive almost three\\n-\\nfold growth \\n-\\n \\nfrom 15 \\ncountries in 2005 up to 43 countries \\nin 2020.\\n \\nTherefore, the gas market will become increasingly more interconnected and less \\nregionalised due to the extension of total gas expor\\nts according to LNG developments. \\n \\nOver the \\nlong term\\n, growth in LNG trade is expected to be\\n \\nsupported by the ongoing \\nramp\\n-\\nup of new LNG projects and the associated growth in contracted supply. Total \\nliquefaction capacity rose from 271 mtpa in 2010 up to 4\\n54 mtpa in 2020, with respective \\ntotal regasification capacity from 572 mtpa up to 947 mtpa.

It \\n\\'touched\\' upon the short\\n-\\nterm targets of the suppliers and portfolio players to optimize \\ntheir trading strategies a\\nlong with 2020 as well as reconsidering old and signing new \\nlong\\n-\\nterm agreements at lower levels of oil indexation, between 10 and 11%, record low \\nlevels, compared to the earlier 14% slope contracts. The oil and gas majors have been \\nseriously challenged by\\n \\nsevere losses in earnings, negative cash flows leading to \\nmassive asset write\\n-\\ndowns amid high leverage of 30% across the industry.

Though some LNG \\nlegacy buyers in Asia, such as Japan, might focus on increased flexibility and reluctance \\nto commit lon\\nger\\n-\\nterm due to energy transition uncertainties, there are definitely buyers \\nfrom developing Asia, such as China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, who will cont\\ninue to look \\nat term contracts.\\n \\nTraditional long\\n-\\nterm, oil\\n-\\nindexed contracts \\nhave \\ndominat\\ned\\n \\nthe global natu\\nral gas \\nmarkets.

The LNG \\nvalue ch\\nain is becoming more complex and less integrated, LNG can now change \\nmultiple intermediaries or take several routes to reach the end market. \\n \\nLNG market transformation is encouraging a wider range of players to participate and \\ncollaborate across the LNG va\\nlue chain. Growing LNG demand and market liquidity \\nhave attracted a host of players to expand their presence in LNG trading. These include \\ninternational oil companies (IOCs) and national oil companies (NOCs), commodity \\ntraders, and LNG buyers, such as gas \\nand power utilities. Portfolio deals are \\nincreasingly preferred, accounting for 50% of total deal volume in 2017, up from 28% in \\n\\naccounted for roughly one\\n-\\ntenth of global LNG t\\nrade in 2017 while boosting market \\nliquidity and shorter\\n-\\nterm contracting.\\n \\nMajor LNG suppliers and buyers are also in the process of setting up LNG trading and \\noptimization arms to capture the full value of flexibilities or optionalities and better \\nmanage \\nLNG\\n-\\nsourcing risk\\n, \\ngiven the short\\n-\\nterm challenge of post\\n-\\nCOVID recovery and \\nlonger\\n-\\nterm perspective of the energy transition. Qatar Petroleum (QP) continues to \\nbuild a trading desk to rival oil majors and trading houses and to help smooth out spot \\ngas \\nprice spikes.

At the same time, \\ntraditional oil\\n-\\nindexed gas pricing is increasingly being complem\\nented by the gas\\n-\\nhub \\nmodel, where\\n \\nLNG price\\ns are defined as a function of prevailing spot prices in various \\nregional markets. Globally, gas indexed LNG supply volumes are gradually increasing \\nwith a growing share of contract prices linked to traded hubs (US HH \\n-\\n \\nHenry Hub, Dutch \\nTitle Transfer Faci\\nlity \\n-\\n \\n\\n-\\n \\nNBP, Japan\\n-\\nKorea Marker \\n-\\n \\nJKM) as opposed to traditional oil\\n-\\nindexation.\\n \\nThere is a growing disconnect between \\noil\\n-\\nlinked prices and new contract prices as they are more dependent on gas trading \\nhubs\\n. Glowing liq\\nuidity of the market, as mentioned earlier, is contributing to a reliable \\nand secure gas price benchmarking. While considering the rising gas\\n-\\nhub\\n-\\nbased LNG \\n \\n210\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\npricing, it is important to mention the variation of gas\\n-\\npricing mechanisms in each of the \\nkey natur\\nal gas markets in America, Europe, and Asia.\\n \\nIn the US, LNG price is disconnected from oil indexation and follows the gas\\n-\\nto\\n-\\ngas \\ncompetition in the US, referenced by Henry Hub. In Europe, the gas pricing pattern \\nrepresents LNG competing with pipeline gas, \\noil indexation of traditional pipeline gas \\ncontracts has been supplemented by gas\\n-\\non\\n-\\ngas pricing formulae, tied to competing \\ngas prices at gas hubs such as TTF and NBP. \\n \\nIn Asia, on the contrary, LNG has historically been indexed against crude oil prices a\\nnd \\ncontinues to be predominantly oil\\n-\\nindexed.\\n \\nDomestic price\\n-\\nsetting mechanisms are also \\neither regulated or \\ndepend\\n \\non oil indexation\\n. At present Asian LNG market \\n\\n \\naccounting \\nfor over 70% of global LNG trade in 2020 \\n\\n \\npricing mechanism is evolving. LNG is\\n \\nof \\nprimary concern in Asia as regional pipeline networks are underdeveloped. There \\nare\\n \\nno regionally organised exchanges or established pricing gas hubs due to the limited \\nliquidity and depth of the local LNG market.\\n \\n \\nThe emergence of U.S. natural gas and\\n \\nLNG on the global marketplace, on the supply \\nside, and Japan\\'s post\\n-\\nFukushima reliance on LNG on the demand side were leading \\nto the transformation of LNG market mechanics and enhanced commoditisation of LNG. \\nFurther liberalisation of the power and gas ma\\nrkets together with market regulations \\nproviding for third\\n-\\nparty access to the existing gas and LNG infrastructure have been \\ncontributing to this trend as well. LNG trade pattern now is backing the growing \\ncommoditisation, liquidity, and flexibility trend \\nwith (i) higher share of spot and short\\n-\\nterm LNG trades in overall trading, (ii) the rise of the LNG portfolio players and increase \\nof flexibility in destination clause contracts, (iii) growth in gas\\n-\\non\\n-\\ngas indexation pricing, \\n(iv) smaller\\n-\\nscale volumes of\\n \\nthe contracts and (v) increased forward\\n-\\nlooking liquidity, \\netc. \\n \\n\\'Greener\\' LNG to capture the minds of the industry stakeholders \\n \\n\\n-\\ncarbon\\n \\nproperties on top of price \\ncompetitiveness.

In this context, it is important to consider the impact that \\nChinese trade tariffs will have\\n \\nover the development of new LNG projects, especially in \\nthe US though there is a sign of selective exception of the Chinese tariffs regarding the \\nUS LNG in the past years and re\\n-\\nemergence of new long\\n-\\nterm sales and purchase \\nagreements concluded between th\\ne US LNG producers and major national Chinese \\nLNG consuming e\\nntities.\\n \\nSeveral LNG regasification terminals could be commissioned, including under\\n-\\nconstruction projects, representing about 65 mtpa capacity, as well as proposed \\nregasification projects with 2\\n00 mtpa capacity between 2020 and 2050\\n \\nOverall, it is forecast that over the outlook period pipeline imports to China will reach \\napproximately 100 bcm in 2030 and almost 150 bcm in 2050, predominately sourced \\nfrom Russia and Turkmenistan. \\n \\nThe share of LNG\\n \\nimports will still be slightly larger (57%) than pipeline imports (43%) \\nby 2050.

It is unclear if South Korea \\nwill join the effort to pr\\nomote US LNG to the Asian market spearheaded by Japan, as \\nthe domestic market for LNG in Korea is poised to grow. \\n \\nNorth America\\n \\n2020\\n \\nnatural gas exports (intra\\n-\\n \\nand inter\\n-\\nregional trade) from North America were \\naround 200 bcm, of which nearly 48 bcm (34 mt of LNG) was exported as LNG, all from \\n \\n220\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nthe US to consumer markets.\\n \\nFurthermore, in 2020 around 150\\n \\nbcm pipe gas was \\ntraded between t\\nhe US, Canada and Mexico. \\n \\nBy 2050, it is forecast that about 30% of all proposed LNG production capacity in the \\nworld will originate from Nort\\nh America, including the US (260\\n \\nmtpa),\\n \\nCanada (90 mtpa) \\nand Mexico (20\\n \\nmtpa). Thus, the US is expected to lead capacity growth in global LNG \\nliquefaction and will be the third\\n-\\nlargest LNG supplier in the world by 2050,\\n \\nas long as \\nUS LNG prices remain competitive, in particular for the large Asian consumers.\\n \\nUS \\nLNG \\nexports \\nst\\narted first in \\n2016\\n, and since then the country has witnessed a \\ntremendous expansion in \\nLNG export\\n \\ncapacity by turning into \\n\\n-\\nlargest \\nLNG exporter \\nonly in four years, \\nonly \\nbehind Australia and Qatar.

Over the outlook period, \\nthe US is expected to be the key source of global LNG export growth. Hence, with \\naround 260 mtpa LNG capacity, the US has great p\\notential to become one of the largest \\nLNG exporters, as long as US gas prices remain competitive, particularly in emerging \\nAsian markets. On that premise, we forecast that US LNG exports will grow by an \\naverage growth rate of 3.5% p.a., from the current le\\nvel to nearly 105 mtpa by 2050.\\n \\nCanada\\n \\nhas enormous natural gas reserves and a huge potential to participate in a \\nrobust LNG market.\\n \\nAbout 300\\n \\nmtpa of LNG export facilities have been proposed in \\nCanada over the last few years, but due to the policies and e\\nnvironmental groups in \\nCanada, we estimate by 2050 that only around \\n90\\n \\nmtpa of these projects will have the \\npotential to come online.\\n \\nMexico.\\n \\nMexico will increase its reliance on gas pipeline imports from the US to meet \\nthe domestic demand (increased power\\n \\nand greater industrial demand) due to a 28% \\ndecline in domestic natural gas production in the mid\\n-\\nterm (2021\\n-\\n2025). The long\\n-\\nterm \\ntrajectory for Mexican LNG demand\\n \\nis in the downturn to a certain degree because of \\nthe development of US\\n-\\nMexican cross\\n-\\nborde\\n\\ndomestic gas network. \\n \\nAt the same time, rising appetite from Asian buyers amid the pricing and demand spike \\n\\n-\\nexporting projects. Developing export capacity for \\nLNG due to its s\\ntrategic location on the west coast of Mexico suggests faster and \\ncheaper\\n \\nroutes to Asia, therefore, allowing the US gas exports to bypass the Panama \\nCanal and reach Pacific demand markets with tangible environmental benefits too. \\n \\n221\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nMexico Pacific Limited (M\\nPL), the lead developer of the North American LNG export \\nproject on the Gulf of California, is approaching the FID of about 14 mtpa of LNG from \\na site that can draw on gas from the Permian basin across the border in Texas and from \\n\\nIt also takes into consideration reduced carbon footprint \\ntechnologies by seeking to curtail the production of emissions. The US Sempra is also \\nadvancing plans to expand the\\n \\nEnergia Costa Azul\\n \\n(3 mpta)\\n \\nexport project in Mexico \\nwith the additional Phase 2 of 12 mtpa.\\n \\nEurasia\\n \\nEurasia is a net exporter of gas and exported about 340 bcm, mostly originat\\ning\\n \\nfrom \\nRussia with around 250 bcm. The region exports\\n \\nmore pipe gas than LNG.

This is partic\\nularly true of the \\nTurkmenistan\\n-\\nAfghanistan\\n-\\nPakistan\\n-\\nIndia (TAPI) pipeline, which would export gas from \\nTurkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India.

Production from the NFE will start \\nby the fourth quarter of 2025 and reach \\nfull capacity by late 2026 or early 2027. QE signed a contract covering major onshore \\nengineering, procurement and construction (EPC) of the underlying expansion project, \\nwith CTJV, a joint venture between Chiyoda an\\nd Technip. A second phase, known as \\nthe North Field South (NFS) project, \\nwhich\\n \\nwould add two 8\\n \\nmtpa liquefaction trains, is \\n\\n \\nmtpa to 126 mtpa by \\nend of 2027.

Positive \\nmarket sentiment, from the LNG supplier \\nperspective, due to the new highs of global \\ngas prices together with a massive supply crunch are favouring the process.\\n \\nAlthough some LNG buyers have been pushing for more hub and gas\\n-\\non\\n-\\ngas pricing, \\noil\\n-\\nindexed pricing, attaining record\\n-\\nlow Brent\\n-\\nlinked t\\nerms of 2020, is preferred by some \\nLNG buyers in Asia.

The pipeline gas exports from Russia, \\nNorth Africa and Norway are expected to persist because they have the lowest marginal \\ncosts. \\n \\nThe differing sources of supply are expected to add to greater price flexibility on the \\nEuropean market, as is the further decrease in oil\\n-\\nlinked contracting. On the downside, \\nthat will diminish the consumer options to withdraw more oil\\n-\\nlinked gas \\nin case of \\ninternational gas price swings, and, in the case of smaller long\\n-\\nterm supplier obligations, \\nwill significantly increase volume risks. The new situation on the market will require \\nadditional\\n \\nstructural changes.\\n \\nBetween the gas source diversificat\\nion policy and more available infrastructure, an \\nincreasing share of those imports will be from LNG. This is also due to the fact that \\nEurope is the residual market for LNG shipments\\n.\\n \\nNatural gas demand in Europe is starting to decrease as decarbonisation \\n\\n\\nthe \\nenergy mix. \\n \\n \\n \\n228\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nThe five largest European gas import markets in 2020 were Germany, Italy, France, \\n\\nfor the long\\n-\\nterm as well.\\n \\nAfrica\\n \\nIn 2020\\n, natural gas exports from Africa were around 95 bcm, out of which 62 bcm (45 \\nmt LNG) was exported as LNG from Nigeria, Algeria, Angola, Egypt, Cameroon and \\nEquatorial Guinea. Hence, the continent supplied 13% of global LNG expo\\nrts.  \\nAdditionally, around 33 bcm pipeline \\ngas was traded to Europe\\n. \\n \\nAfrica has about 72\\n \\nmtpa of LNG liquefaction capacity.

All pipeline trade is \\nconducted within the region, mostly from Bolivia, and will remain at \\nor below \\nthe cur\\nrent \\nlevel of 12 bcma over the coming decades.\\n \\nThere is about 45 mtpa of existing LNG regasification capacity, and a further over 45 \\nmtpa of regasification projects in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, The Dominican Republic, E\\nl \\nSalvador, \\nBahamas, Nicaragua \\nand els\\newhere that will be developed over the outlook \\nperiod.\\n \\nLNG Trade.\\n \\nLatin American LNG demand is expected to have a record year in 2021. \\n \\nSo far, US LNG exports to Latin America have been modest, with the largest markets \\nof Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia\\n, and Mexico importing from the US about 14.2 \\nmcm/day of LNG in 2020, according to the US Energy Information Administration. \\n \\nOverall, LNG heralds a new era for the region with the substitution of the more \\nexpensive and dirtier petroleum fuel\\n \\nfor electrici\\nty generation along with hydropower. \\nFurthermore, due to the rise in demand and decline in production, the region will \\ngradually emerge as a net importer of LNG. It is forecast that LNG imports will increase \\nat an average growth rate of 5.8% p.a. to about \\n77 bcma (56 mtpa) by 2050 from the \\ncurrent (2020) 14 bcma (10 mt), primarily sourced from the US.  \\n \\n \\n231\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nBolivia\\n \\nhas solid fundamentals to support a bright natural gas future\\n,\\n \\nbut gas output \\ndecline and growing investment requirements remain challenging, partia\\nlly due to the \\noverall global energy transition process gaining momentum and fossil fuel investments \\nslowing down. (Output peaked at 20 bcma in 2014 and fell to 15 bcma in 2020, the same \\nlevel it was at in 2011.) Bolivia is the main supplier of pipeline ga\\ns to Brazil and \\nArgentina\\n,\\n \\n\\nIt possesses a strong competitive advantage in terms of having low production costs, \\n\\nn pre\\n-\\nsalt.\\n \\nThe \\nBrazilian\\n \\ngas market is highly reliant on imports, despite its giant gas reserves \\ndiscoveries in the pre\\n-\\nsalt as Brazil experiencing the bottlenecks in infrastructure and \\nlogistics to offload gas from the pre\\n-\\nsalt to the coast. \\n \\nBrazil,\\n \\nbei\\nng one of the BRICS, is seeking higher energy stability through extensive use \\nof more gas\\n-\\n\\ngrow in the coming decades in support of growing population, urbanization and \\nenhanced l\\nabour productivity levels and forecasted long\\n-\\nterm growth of the Brazilian \\neconomy in real terms projected at 3.3% between 2020 and 2050. \\n \\nAs natural gas demand in the power sector rises, Brazil will necessarily need LNG \\nimports. It is suggested that \\nBrazil should utilise LNG for its electricity market which \\ncould be secured with long\\n-\\nterm contracts. Over the outlook period, Brazil is set to be \\nat the centre of LNG demand in Latin America. It is expected that the country will \\nincrease its imports to ar\\nound 44 bcma, mainly due to the LNG imports ramping up to \\n30 mt LNG from the global market, mostly the US, by 2050.\\n \\nArgentina \\nis aiming to ramp up its local supply with a focus on the giant Vaca Muerta \\nshale basin, due to which the country is possessing th\\ne second\\n-\\nlargest global shale gas \\nreserves, and to cut its imports reliance. Yet the Vaca Muerta investment programme is \\nunder constant pressure.\\n \\nConclusion\\n \\nIn conclusion, in the long run\\n,\\n \\nthe \\nenergy transition \\nwill be the \\nsingle key challenge \\nfacing \\nthe global \\nnatural gas trade\\n, with a primar\\ny focus on LNG\\n. It will be defining the rules of \\nthe game for the natural gas industry as a whole as well as will be setting boundary \\nconditions for the increasing natural gas trade. Among the main trends that nat\\nural gas \\nindustry stakeholders have to take into consideration are the following:\\n \\n \\nInvestment and moneti\\ns\\nation challenge\\n. Gas and LNG are central to the energy \\ntransition strategies of many NOCs (national oil companies) and IOCs (international \\noil companies\\n). LNG new supply build\\n-\\nout prospects are recovering quickly on the \\nback of post\\n-\\nCOVID demand rebound and high gas prices.  Optimistic projections \\nare based on the 1H 2021 FID reached by two major NOCs\\n\\nled LNG liquefaction \\nprojects in GECF member countries\\n \\nwith the total nameplate capacity of 45 mtpa \\n\\n \\nNorth Field East Expansion project of 32 mtpa in Qatar and Baltic LNG (Ust\\n-\\nLuga) \\nof 13 mtpa in Russia.

Finance of high\\n-\\ncost, capital\\n-\\nintensive and long\\n-\\npayback projects will be striving to get to the\\n \\ncompletion stage due to uncertainty \\nover longer\\n-\\nterm gas demand multiplied by conventional project payback period of \\n10\\n-\\n15 years. \\nSuch\\n \\na challenge might be confronted by the long\\n-\\nterm commitments \\nbetween LNG producers and consumers, where long\\n-\\nterm alignm\\nent in vision from \\nthe LNG industry stakeholders is a prerequisite. \\n \\n \\nCost controls.\\n \\nHigh volatility in LNG prices, seen in the last years, with significant \\ndownside risks is calling for the whole LNG value\\n-\\nchain cost reduction of the \\n\\nnditure (CAPEX), especially while controlling construction \\ncosts, and operating costs (OPEX) due to improved efficiencies and new enabling \\ntechnologies.\\n \\n \\nCarbon\\n-\\nneutral LNG.\\n \\n\\n-\\n\\ncarbon footprint is rapidl\\ny gaining momentum and will be vital for LNG industry \\ndevelopment in the decades to come to match the environmental sustainability of \\nthe energy transition. Many of the largest LNG importers in Asia \\n-\\n \\nJapan, South \\nKorea \\n-\\n \\nand in Europe \\n-\\n \\nSpain, France, the\\n \\nUK \\n-\\n \\nhave pledged to become carbon\\n-\\nneutral by 2050, with China and India by 2060 and 2070 respectively. Governments \\nwill ramp up limiting GHG\\n-\\n\\nturning carbon\\n-\\nneutral LNG into potentially an only avail\\nable offering for key \\nmarkets. LNG stakeholders will commit to \\nt\\naking action to reduce Scope 1 and 2 \\nemissions through the LNG value chain, from sourcing gas through liquefaction, \\nshipping and regasification\\n. The LNG industry will respond by increasing car\\nbon \\nmitigation efforts, including carbon capture and storage (CCS).\\n \\n \\n \\nDiversifying away to low\\n-\\ncarbon alternatives\\n. Gas producers will be increasingly \\ndiversifying into low\\n-\\ncarbon alternatives to natural gas.

Liquefaction will be \\ndominating the gas infrastructure funding, also spotlighted on \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nregion. \\n \\nThe scope of pipeline investment over the next 30 years will be less than the past 30 \\nyears, as \\nmany large\\n-\\nscale pipeline investments hav\\ne already been made.   Most new \\ngas pipeline investment will be concentrated in Eurasia with new links to customers in \\nEurope and Asia, notably Power of Siberia 1 a\\nnd Central Asia\\n-\\nChina line D.\\n \\nFor LNG, the rapid \\nbuild\\n-\\nup of LNG supply capacity in the 2020\\ns is widely expected to \\noutpace demand growth.  After the current wave of projects, investment is expected to \\nsubside for approximately 10 years as demand catches up with supply.\\n \\nExist\\ning and new LNG projects will be facing two major concerns\\n: one relating\\n \\nto \\nachieving adequate profitability and secondly the growing issue of environmental \\nacceptability\\n \\nand more \\n\\n \\nInvestors to challenge the fossil fuel industry, including natural gas, in the long run with \\ntightened fina\\nncial resources due to accelerated energy transition and climate change \\nagenda pressures.\\n \\nGlobal energy investment\\n \\nGlobal energy investments are expected to strongly regain to USD1.9 trillion\\n \\nin 2021\\n \\nor \\nby around 10% compared to the 2020 level\\n, rebounding \\nto the pre\\n-\\nCOVID state\\n.\\n \\nClimate \\nagenda\\n-\\n\\nstreamlining more financing to be allocated the renewables and electricity at the cost of \\nfossil fuels.\\n \\n \\nThe power sector funding is t\\nrending to outperform the legacy oil and gas supply \\ninvestments\\n \\nin \\nthe 6\\nth\\n \\nconsecutive year\\n \\nand to reach a record USD820 billion with \\nrenewables accounting for over 2/3 of it (USD530 billion) in 2021.

Prior to the critical year of 2020, historical upstream \\ninvestments between 2010 and 2019 were at USD 570 billio\\nn worldwide indicating a \\ntremendous accumulative increase compared to the investment volume during the \\n2000s. Furthermore, USD 472 billion investment was made in gas transportation and \\ntrade infrastructure between 2010 and 2019 showing an increase of 67% c\\nompared to \\nthe \\ninvestment made between 2000 and 2009\\n.\\n \\nOne of the key factors that can explain the dramatic growth in global gas investment \\nduring the 2010s is the ambitious plans of the US to produce shale gas from \\nunconventional resources. 2012 was the fi\\nrst year that the US was able to outpace \\nRussia in gas production since 1982, due to its intensive investment in shale gas \\nexploration and production. Between 2010 and 2020, USD 481 bn investment was made \\nin upstream gas activities in the North American re\\ngion, representing 64% of global \\nupstream investments in the past decade. \\n \\nThe main determinants of the flourishing shale gas investment, particularly in the US \\nduring the last decade, are those factors which can provide the investing companies \\nwith an ass\\nurance of profi\\ntability. These factors include\\n \\ninstitutions such as government \\npolicy, namely a favourable regulatory environment that has continuously encouraged \\ninvestment in this particular energy sector; technological factors such as innovation and \\nR&D\\n \\nin new engineering techniques and infrastructure development; market factors \\nencompassing high gas prices especially in the 2000s, private entrepreneurship as well \\nas economic prosperity; and last but not least, geological factors such as water \\navailabili\\nty, property rights such as land and mineral rights ownership, as the \\ndevelopment of shale gas requires plenty of water for hydraulic horizontal sub\\n-\\nsoil \\ndrilling.   \\n \\nNatural gas investment long\\n-\\nterm \\noutlook\\n \\n2020 \\n-\\n \\n2050\\n \\nAlthough most of this projected USD8\\n.7 trillion earmarked for gas investment is required \\nin the natural gas exploration and production sectors, the trade infrastructure still \\nrequires over USD600 billion of capital in 2020 prices.\\n \\nThe upstream\\n \\nis expected to increase its share from a historical 85% to nearly 95% \\nwhile already being the main driver for gas industry investment, as production shifts to \\n \\n235\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ncapital\\n-\\nintensive unconventional sources both in and outside the GECF. This is \\nconnected to two \\nfactors. \\n \\nFirst, unconventional projects will play a much larger role in upstream gas development. \\nThey have much higher capital requirements than conventional projects despite the \\nlearning curve and the new technologies that are being introduced into gas \\nproduction.\\n \\nSecond, there is a decrease in projected investment in pipeline and regas as compared \\nto the historical levels as there is already enough capacity and capital costs are trending \\ndown because of technological advancement.\\n \\nFigure 5.\\n11\\n. \\nNatural\\n \\ngas investment by region 2020\\n-\\n2050 (real billion USD)\\n \\n \\nSource: GECF Secretariat based on data from the GECF GGM\\n \\nAs already mentioned, 2020 has been a game\\n-\\nchanging year, leading the industry to \\nquestion the future of gas investme\\nnts. However, this is not a new issue for energy \\nsector investment as the sector has already experienced a chaotic situation in 2008 \\nwhen the financial crisis caused energy investment to plunge worldwide. In response to \\nthe 2008 financial crisis and to pre\\nvent losing too much money, the major investing oil \\nand gas companies slowed many ongoing projects and cut back their spending on \\ndrilling wells and constructing pipelines.\\n \\nThere is an expected growth in LNG consumption in future decades because of \\npopulation growth, growing economic prosperity in developing countries (e.g. China and \\nIndia), favourable government regulations and actions to reduce air pollution. Although \\nthe g\\nrowth in demand drives an increase in gas investment, LNG development projects \\nmay be difficult to finance in the same way as before due to the prospect of market \\nchanges. It is less likely in coming decades that LNG projects will be financed by project\\n-\\nle\\nvel debt, which requires long\\n-\\nterm sales and purchase agreements. \\n \\n \\n236\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nIn sum, regardless of any financing structural changes due to market ambiguities, the \\nlevel of investment is expected to grow in the long\\n \\nterm. It is estimated that total gas \\ninvestment (in\\ncluding upstream and midstream activities) between 2020 and 2050 will \\nreach about USD 8.7 trillion from a total of USD 260 bn in 2020 to USD 350 bn in 2050.\\n \\nLNG investment will have substantial government support in various countries such as \\nthe US, Qatar \\nand Russia in order to meet the growing demand in \\nAsia \\nPacific\\n \\nand \\nEuropean markets. Following global growth in LNG upstream and transportation \\ninvestment, unlike the historical picture, North America will see a decline in upstream \\ngas investments, while non\\n-\\nOECD Asia, Eurasia and Africa will be growing regions for \\ng\\nas investment. \\n \\nRegional gas investment by \\nupstream and midstream\\n \\nThe developments in upstream that are planned in Algerian unconventional projects \\nafter 2030, and new projects both in Mozambique and Tanzania (to a lesser extent, \\nNigeria, Egypt and Senegal\\n) will drive African investment, while some new LNG capacity \\ninvestment is also expected to take place. \\n \\nEurasia investment past\\n-\\n2035 is expected to be driven by the rise in capital intensity, \\nwhile pipeline investment, as compared to 2013\\n-\\n2020 investment,\\n \\nwill be significantly \\nless after 2030, as \\nthe connection of large\\n-\\nscale\\n \\npipeline projects linking gas output from \\nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan to European and \\nChinese consumers is established.\\n \\nInvestment in \\nAsia Pacific\\n \\nwil\\nl mostly be driven by upstream in China and Australia, as \\nwell as India, with required capital intensity increase profoundly impacting the \\ninvestment outlays.\\n \\nThe rise of \\nunconventionals \\nin the upstream is a global driver for investment. It will lead \\nto an\\n \\nincrease in capital costs, the most pronounced in Africa, Asia, and Eurasia (after \\n2035). In North America, \\nunconventionals \\nwill remain the only new source of gas. Most \\nof the US unconventional sources are yet\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nfind and will come at an increased capital\\n \\ncost as compared to the shale boom resources.\\n \\nThe decisions for more capital\\n-\\nintensive upstream investment in Asia will be driven by \\nnon\\n-\\ncommercial reasons because indigenous gas production is expected to be on the \\nlosing side of the cost curve at least u\\nntil the end\\n-\\n2020s. This is particularly important \\nfor China, where energy security considerations will accelerate \\nproduction\\n \\ndevelopment \\ndespite affordable and abundant LNG available during the Outlook period.\\n \\nThe scope of pipeline investment over the nex\\nt 30 years will be slightly less than in the \\npast 30 years. Most investment in large\\n-\\nscale pipeline projects globally (SCP, TANAP, \\nNord Stream 2, Turkish Stream and the Power of Siberia, as well as the North American \\npipeline network upgrades) has been mad\\ne, though it might take several years till all \\nthose pipelines start and ramp\\n-\\nup volumes. \\n \\n \\n237\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nFor geographical reasons, most gas pipeline investment will still be concentrated in \\nEurasia, where new links between consumers from Europe and Asia and the gas\\n-\\nprod\\nucing region will be established. For the Outlook horizon in Eurasia, we assume \\ninvestment in two pipeline expansions \\n-\\n \\nPower of Siberia and Nord Stream \\n\\n \\nwhich are \\nmade and two major pipeline investment projects in the region around 2030 \\n\\n \\nAltai \\n(Power of\\n \\nSiberia\\n-\\n2) pipeline and Central Asia\\n-\\nChina line D. \\n \\nThe other region focused on pipeline expansion will be the Middle East, with several \\nprojects to link producing countries (Egypt, Israel and Cyprus) together and with \\nconsumers both within (Jordan, Leban\\non) and outside the region (Greece, Italy, \\nTurkey). As some countries are expected to shift from consumer to producer status, and \\nthere is underutili\\ns\\ned LNG capacity in the region, there is an additional rationale to \\nexpand the pipeline network in the Midd\\nle East. \\n \\nThere will be less need for pipeline investment in Europe, in the next 30 years. The \\npipeline networks in Europe, including those through Turkey, were largely upgraded in \\nthe last ten years. This along with the underutilised capacity of existing \\npipelines and \\nactive use of LNG that started in recent years are the main drivers behind the slowdown \\nin European pipeline investment.

The narrower gap in glob\\nal gas production \\nin the HS is due to blue hydrogen production. The share of the GECF countries \\nin natural gas production will increase to 47% by 2050. This share is forecast \\nto be higher at 49% and 62%, respectively, in the HS and the ETS by the \\nOutlook h\\norizon.\\n \\n \\nIn the HS, almost 46% of total hydrogen production will be sourced \\nfrom\\n \\nblue \\nhydrogen. However, the share of \\nthe total\\n \\nnatural gas\\n-\\nbased hydrogen \\ngeneration, including other clean pathways such as turquoise hydrogen, is \\nalmost half of the \\nglobal\\n \\npr\\noduction. \\n \\n \\nNearly 47% of total hydrogen production (290 Mt) is forecast to come from \\ngreen hydrogen production.\\n \\n \\nIn the HS around 145 Mt of H2 will be traded annually by 2050 accounting for \\nmore than 23% of the total hydrogen supply and demand by then. \\nEurope and \\nAsia Pacific will import the majority of the hydrogen while almost all regions will \\nexport this clean fuel.\\n \\n \\nGECF countries have a solid potential to export almost half of the hydrogen \\ntrade, mainly from Eurasia, North Africa and the Middle East.\\n \\n \\n242\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nThis chapter \\ncasts a critical eye over significant developments in the energy transition, \\nanalysing them from an oil and gas perspective and weighing up the o\\npportunities they \\ncould present in the\\n \\nEnergy Transition Scenario (ETS) and Hydrogen Scenario (H\\nS\\n).\\n \\nThe \\nscenarios assess the energy transition drivers, their potential and possible \\ndevelopments over the long\\n-\\nterm, their impact on global energy configuration and \\ncarbon emissions as well as the future role of natural gas. \\n \\n6.1 \\nOverview\\n \\nThe key climate\\n-\\nrelated objective agreed upon at the 2015 Paris Conference on Climate \\nChange (COP21) \\nwas\\n \\nto restrict global warming to less than 2\\n°\\nC, ideally 1.5\\n°\\nC, by 2100 \\ncompared to pre\\n-\\nindustrial levels. \\nThe main task for \\nt\\nhe Glasgow meeting \\n(COP26)\\n \\n-\\nheld in November \\n2021\\n-\\n \\nwas to finalise the procedures for implementation of the \\nCOP21.\\n \\nThe Glasgow Climate Pact\\n \\nasks countries to \\naccelerate \\nefforts towards the phase\\n-\\nout \\nof unabated\\n \\ncoal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies\\n.

On the other hand, \\nat the GECF,\\n \\nwe think\\n \\nin the future, oil and gas coun\\ntries and companies have an \\nopportunity to invest, lead and shape the transformation of the global energy sector from \\nfossil\\n-\\nbased fuels to zero\\n-\\ncarbon economies.\\n \\n6.2 \\nStory Line Scenarios and Key Assumptions\\n \\nEnergy transition and emission reductions scenar\\nios can aid in the investigation of \\ntechnology choices and regulatory actions that can contribute significantly to the \\naccomplishment of these objectives.

There is no doubt that \\nthe above\\n-\\nm\\nentioned transition will take place in the long\\n \\nterm. The main debate that is \\nunderway currently is only about the multitude of pathways at regional and sectoral \\nlevels which could be chosen\\n \\nto achieve such a transformation.\\n \\nThat being said, a\\nny modelling \\nis challenging due to the variety of variables and their \\ncomplicated interplay. As part of a larger research endeavo\\nu\\nr, we \\nhave \\nattempted to cut \\nthrough the complexity by analy\\ns\\ning the degree of change necessary in each \\ncomponent of the global economy to a\\nchieve a 1.5\\n-\\ndegree route. \\nThe ETS\\n \\nkey \\nmodelling drivers \\nare\\n:\\n \\n \\nTo reduce\\n \\nthe\\n \\nfinal energy intensity of GDP\\n,\\n \\n \\nTo apply high c\\narbon prices per ton of CO\\n2\\n,\\n \\n \\nTo increase the e\\nlectrification of end\\n-\\nusers,\\n \\n \\nTo increase the share of renewables in power generation\\n \\nled by solar and wind,\\n \\n \\nTo increase the s\\nhare of EVs and HEVs in total vehicles sales,\\n \\n \\nTo apply widely c\\narbon capture, use, and storage (CCS/CCUS)\\n \\nplants\\n,\\n \\nwhich illustrate what the world energy system might look like through \\nto \\n2050 based on \\ncurrent trends\\n. This \\nhas \\nenabled us to account for variability in the rate of emissions \\nreductions among some of the major sources of GHGs, such as generating power and \\ntransportation, without becoming predictive. \\nIt was noted\\n \\nthat the scenario suggest\\ns\\n \\nthe \\nnecessity fo\\nr rapid, all\\n-\\nhands\\n-\\non\\n-\\ndeck measures to substantially cut GHG emissions.\\n \\nMore specifically, \\nin the \\nETS\\n \\nbetween 2020 and 2050\\n,\\n \\nthere are dramatic increases in \\ncarbon prices, growth in solar and wind power generation, as well as total sales volume\\ns\\n \\nof EVs and\\n \\nHEVs. \\nAdditionally\\n, \\nthe modelling suggests \\nstrong\\n \\ngrowth in\\n \\nelectrification \\nby end\\n-\\nusers\\n.\\n \\nWith more \\nrenewables \\ninvestment in power generation, particularly in \\nwestern countries, the share of fossil fuels in the \\nglobal \\nenergy mix will drop. CCUS \\nwill \\nabate\\n \\nthe\\n \\nremaining emission\\ns\\n,\\n \\nand the decline \\nin \\nenergy intensity \\nwill gradually \\naccelerate\\n. \\n \\nThe\\n \\n\\n\\nHS scenario avoids implementing the other \\ndecarbonisation pathways such as efficiency improvement in order to assess the \\nimpacts of the possible and expectable hydrogen penetration into the energy system \\npurely. The aim of developing a dedicated hydrogen s\\ncenario is that hydrogen is \\nexpected to be a decarbonisation pathway in which fossil fuels can play a role\\n,\\n \\n \\n244\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nespecially natural gas. Natural gas with CCUS can serve\\n \\nthe benefits of both energy \\nconsumers and producers. CCUS is an enabler to low\\n-\\ncarbon natura\\nl gas production \\nthrough capturing the gas from natural gas processing operations. In addition, it unlocks \\nthe potential of natural gas \\nby\\n \\nproducing blue hydrogen in energy demand regions.\\n \\nThe \\nHS will account for all the announced hydrogen strategies that \\nmostly focus on the green \\nhydrogen pathway as well as the relative ramp\\n-\\nup of blue hydrogen technologies and \\ncost reduction. The HS will add to a higher uptake of natural gas decarbonisation with \\nthe use of pre\\n-\\ncombustion CCS/CCUS. \\n \\nRegarding the \\nhydrogen \\nassumptions in the ETS, decarbonis\\nation is more intensified \\nas it sparks new uses for hydrogen, particularly in areas where CO\\n2\\n \\nreduction is difficult. \\nHowever, it is important to note that t\\no supply this hydrogen, an amount of water equal \\nto one\\n-\\nthird of \\nthe total water utili\\ns\\ned in the energy industry today would be required. \\nDepending on how carbon\\n-\\nfree hydrogen is generated\\n \\n(blue or green)\\n, it also \\nnecessitates either a substantial portion of carbon\\n-\\nfree electricity, corresponding to 80% \\nof today\\n\\ns power\\n \\ngeneration capacity, making it the sector with the highest power usage\\n, \\nor a considerable amount of natural gas, amounting to 45% of \\ncurrent\\n \\nconsumption, \\nnecessitating the capture of 460 Mt\\n \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nand storage in approximately 150 large\\n-\\nscale \\nCO\\n2\\n \\nstorage faci\\nliti\\nes \\n(3)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\nAs noted, higher carbon prices, \\nsolar and wind energy growth in power generation, and \\nincreased total sales of EV and HEVs are also assumed in RCS, but with smaller \\nincreases than\\n \\nin \\nthe \\nETS\\n. In other key drivers such as strong electrificatio\\nn by users, \\nthere is higher growth and the share of fossil fuels in the energy mix shows a more \\npronounced \\ndownward trend. CCS/CCUS reveals more growth and \\nthe \\ndecline in \\nenergy intensity would \\nalso be more significant\\n \\nunder \\nboth\\n \\nthe ETS and the HS\\n.\\n \\nA\\n \\nsharp increase in carbon prices and \\nthe \\nshare of EVs and HEVs in the transport sector \\nis evident under this assumption. The share of fossil fuels in the primary energy mix will \\ndrop significantly with the ambitious plan of renewables development in the po\\nwer \\ngeneration sector. CCS/CCUS and \\na \\ndecline in energy intensity grow faster. End\\n-\\nuse \\nelectrification will grow \\nmore strongly\\n \\nby 2050 than the trend under the RCS scenario.       \\n \\nThe projections in all the GECF scenarios are projected up to 2050, with a \\ncommon \\nbaseline year of 2020. \\n \\nThe same assumption\\ns\\n \\nfor \\npopulation and \\nGDP growth ra\\ntes are\\n \\napplicable across all \\nthe GECF\\n \\nscenarios\\n \\n(RCS as well as ETS and HS)\\n. \\n \\nOil prices\\n \\nThe HS approach to deriving long\\n-\\nterm oil prices \\nis \\ndifferent from the ETS, which \\nsees \\na rapid ramp\\n-\\nup in oil prices and a rapid drop in oil demand translated into significantly \\nless effort invested into fossil fuels exploration and production.\\n \\nIn\\n \\nthe\\n \\nETS, \\nn\\new\\n \\noil and \\n \\n245\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\ngas\\n \\nprojects \\ncome online and feeding \\nsuppl\\nies\\n,\\n \\nwill increasingly compete with each \\nother over \\ncarbon intensity\\n \\n\\n \\n \\nPotential underinvestment in the oil and gas industry, in its turn leads to a supply\\n-\\ndemand imbalance due to a continuous and rapidly gro\\nwing demand for energy in the \\nworld versus discrete spikes in supply.

Every one of those assumptions will have \\na distinct influence in each energy scenario. It is crucial to note that each scenario is \\nsignificantly distinct from the others, and\\n \\nthat the capacity for radically diverse results \\ncan be observed across all four of them.\\n \\nThe scenario analysis reveal\\ns\\n \\nthat there might be several paths to meeting the Paris \\nclimate objective and achieving a low\\n-\\ncarbon future. Although it is postulated that \\nrenewables and other unconventional energy sources will account for a significant \\nportion of the energy supply mix o\\nver the next 30 years, based on the GECF \\n\\n \\ncalculation, GECF believes that some concerns may limit the pledge to fully replacing \\nfossil fuels, particularly natural gas. The GGM demonstrates that committing to carbon\\n-\\nneutral objectives alone will not be\\n \\nenough to reduce GHG emissions\\n,\\n \\nif not supported \\nby \\nrational and \\nrealistic measures.\\n \\nEnergy\\n-\\nrelated CO2 emissions\\n \\nThe HS and ETS scenarios outline two potential carbon mitigation pathways for energy\\n-\\nrelated activities, with a much more aggressive emission reduction profile for the ETS. \\nThe latter scenario implements \\nstrengthened \\ndecarbonisation options, which are \\nu\\nn\\nde\\nrpinned by the long\\n-\\nterm net\\n-\\nzero targets and strategies announced by different \\ncountries\\n \\nIn 2050, CO\\n2 \\nemissions will shrink by 60% in the ETS compared to the RCS, reaching \\naround 11.7 Gt\\n \\nCO\\n2\\n. Although the ETS trajectory remains \\nin\\ncompatible with the 1.5°C\\n \\ntarget\\ns\\n, it is consistent with the Paris Agreement objective to achieve 2°C by the end of \\nthe century. The ETS is therefore a Paris\\n-\\naligned pathway, which assumes that the \\nworld will approach carbon neutrality by 2070, reflecting different decarbonisation\\n \\nspeeds between developed and developing countries.\\n \\nFor the \\nHS\\n \\nscenario, 2050 emissions will decrease by almos\\nt 9% compared to the RCS, \\nwhich is equivalent to around 2.6 Gt CO\\n2\\n. The implementation of aggressive hydrogen \\ndevelopment contributes, to some ext\\nent, to the reduction in the gap between the RCS \\nand the Paris\\n-\\naligned trajectory.

Despite the fact \\nthat the gas market \\nis projected to shrink in this scenario, the sector has a significant role to play in the \\nenergy transition. As a result, we believe that oil and gas producers, particularly GECF \\nMember Countries, should be prepared to make their operat\\nions more sustainable and \\nrobust.\\n \\nEmissions reduction is a top priority for the gas industry\\n,\\n \\nand the GECF Secretariat \\nsupport\\ns\\n \\nits members in these efforts. The Secretariat strives to favour this opportunity \\nin the framework of the Environmental Knowledge\\n \\nand Solutions (EKS) initiative that \\nhas been established as a \\nmeans of\\n \\nsupport\\ning\\n \\nthe Paris Agreement process and the \\nattainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\\n \\nAlthough the GECF Member Countries are already at the forefront of the energy \\ntransit\\nion and carbon reduction in various ways, they \\nstill \\nneed to improve their \\nEnvironmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) frameworks to avoid being \\naccused of \\n\\ngreenwashing\\n\\n. As a result, the GECF GGO makes a number of \\nrecommendations that might help\\n \\nits \\nm\\nembers\\' gas industries function more sustainably \\nand robust\\nly, which are highlighted below:\\n \\n \\nTo accelerate \\nthe\\n \\nreform\\n \\nof\\n \\nfossil fuel subsidies\\n \\nFossil fuel subsidies that are offered for a long period are not only inefficient but also \\ndangerous due to \\ngradual increases in energy demand and consequently increases in \\nGHG and CO\\n2\\n \\nemissions. Furthermore, as the cost of energy is artificially lower due to \\nthe \\nsubsidies, \\nthis\\n \\nwill drive \\na \\ncontinued dependence on fossil\\n-\\nbased fuels. As a result, \\nsubsidies may \\nallow governments to build or develop new fossil fuel infrastructure, \\nextending the usage of fossil fuels and, as a result, delaying the economic transition to \\nrenewable energy.\\n \\nBesides, low domestic fossil fuel prices have led to immense oil and gas deman\\nd growth \\nthat cannot continue if the oil and gas exporting countries wish to continue exporting. \\nOnly very high price jumps can stop this development, but politically these price jumps \\nare very costly for many governments\\n \\n(4)\\n. Thus, it is recommended that \\ncountries \\ngradually remove fossil fuel subsidies completely, introduce true energy pricing, and \\npromote mechanisms and policies, such as \\ntax changes,\\n \\nfeed\\n-\\nin tariff\\ns\\n \\n(FIT), carbon \\npricing and renewable portfolio standards (RPS).\\n \\n \\nTo improve energy efficienc\\ny\\n \\nEconomic sectors must \\npersist\\n \\nin their pursuit of greater efficiency, lower costs and \\nflawless projects. Governments along with oil and gas corporations must give a clear \\n \\n260\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nsignal to stakeholders that they are capable of being good stewards. In this \\narea\\n, \\nthey \\nmay follow certain policies to encourage whole energy sectors to contribute \\nto\\n \\nenergy \\nefficiency targets. Industry, buildings and transport are \\nthe \\nmain energy consuming \\nsectors in each society.\\n \\nAs for industry, energy intensity has gradually increase\\nd in this diversified sector for \\ndecades, but there is still a significant opportunity for \\nthe \\nindustry to create roughly twice \\nas much output per unit of energy usage \\nby\\n \\n2050. In \\nthe \\nbuilding sector, major attempts \\ncan be directed toward retrofits and oth\\ner brand\\n-\\nnew solutions, such as smart buildings \\nand homes. The majority of houses and commercial establishments that will be standing \\nin 2050 have already been constructed, making efficiency retrofits crucial. Typical \\nretrofits now save 10\\n-\\n40% of energy consumption, but in order to reach their full \\ncapacity, they will need to cover more buildings and offer greater savings per structure. \\n \\nLast but not least is the transport sector, where policies can make effective changes in \\nthe path to ener\\ngy efficiency. Vehicles\\' energy efficiency has risen significantly in recent \\nyears, owing to demanding fuel economy regulations as well as rising fuel prices in \\nmany nations. In fact, countries must implement or continue to enhance their fuel \\neconomy requi\\nrements to guarantee that manufacturers \\nwill\\n \\nsupply a wide choice of \\nfuel\\n-\\nefficient vehicles while avoiding exemptions for categories such as SUVs. \\nFurthermore, more electric cars are coming to market, which decreases overall energy \\nusage and emissions, pa\\nrticularly in places with cleaner electric grids. \\n \\nHowever, increased vehicle fuel efficiency will not solve long\\n-\\nterm energy usage in the \\ntransportation sector if vehicle distance trave\\nl\\nled continues to increase unabated. Local \\nand regional mobility plann\\ning that integrates GHG and mode share objectives will help \\nin the development of comprehensive solutions and the incorporation of emerging \\nmobility alternatives in order to construct sustainable transportation networks. \\nExpanded mobility alternatives, suc\\nh as carpooling and bike\\n-\\nsharing, as well as greater \\npublic contribution to energy efficiency\\n,\\n \\ncan reduce automobile usage and save energy \\nwhen coupled with compact and walkable neighbourhoods. Governments can facilitate \\nsuch solutions and support start\\n-\\nup\\ns that move in this direction.\\n \\nFurthermore, the freight industry may save energy by utili\\ns\\ning mode switching, which \\nprovides smooth transitions between \\nthe \\nhighway, rail, water and air modes\\n.\\n \\nL\\nogistics \\ndigitali\\ns\\nation\\n,\\n \\n\\ngreen corridors\\n\\n \\nand collaborative sh\\nipping agreements to maximi\\ns\\ne \\nvehicle loads and minimi\\ns\\ne empty return hauls\\n \\nare all useful strategies to be considered\\n.  \\n \\n \\nTo reduce methane emissions from flaring and waste gases\\n \\nAccording to the Methane Guiding Principles report \\n(5)\\n, around 145 bcm of gas\\n \\nis flared \\neach year in oil and gas activities across the globe, accounting for 2% of worldwide \\nmethane emissions from petroleum products\\n, which\\n \\nwarrant\\ns\\n \\nattention from industry \\n \\n261\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nexperts to reduce the level. \\n\\n\\nGa\\ns Flaring \\n\\n \\nThematic Research\\n\\n \\n(6)\\n, if oil and gas operators found \\na way of\\n \\nutili\\nsing\\n \\nand sell\\ning\\n \\nthe flared gas rather than los\\ning\\n \\nit, they could make up to \\nUSD \\n82\\n \\nbn. \\nUnfortunately\\n, \\nsome of the GECF Member and Observer Countries \\nwere\\n \\namong the biggest ga\\ns flare\\nr\\ns \\nin 2020\\n, namely\\n \\nAlgeria, Angola, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Malaysia, Russia \\nand Venezuela.\\n \\nFlaring could be decreased in three different ways. In an ideal world, waste gas \\ngeneration is avoided\\n, b\\nut if \\nthis\\n \\nis not possible, waste energy recovery for sale can \\nproduce income. Alternatively, storing (re\\n-\\ninjecting) gases in oil and gas reservoirs is \\nan\\n \\noption. If the waste gas cannot be collected and resold as natural gas or an LNG \\nproduct, or if it cannot be co\\nnserved, it may be utili\\ns\\ned to generate power. If flaring \\ncannot be avoided, boosting flare efficiency can help to minimi\\ns\\ne methane emissions. \\n \\nTaking the above\\n-\\nmentioned into account, according to the GEO ExPro Magazine \\n(7)\\n, \\nthere are seven key actions th\\nat operators can do to reduce gas flaring\\n:\\n \\n1\\n.\\n \\nImprove operational practices (especially around equipment maintenance, to \\n\\n \\n2\\n.\\n \\nUse the gas for operations (e.g. process heat, EOR, or for delivery to a local gas \\ngatheri\\nng system).\\n \\n3\\n.\\n \\nGenerate electricity (e.g. for local and regional consumption), especially when this \\ndisplaces diesel used to power oil and gas field operations.\\n \\n4\\n.\\n \\nExtract associated liquids (e.g. LPG, condensate).\\n \\n5\\n.\\n \\nConvert the gas to liquids (e.g. CNG, LNG or \\nGTL) for sale via a \"virtual pipeline\".\\n \\n6\\n.\\n \\n\\n \\n7\\n.\\n \\nOr, if all else fails, improve the flare\\'s combustion efficiency and reduce methane \\nemissions\\n. \\n \\n \\nTo continue monitoring energy policies and market trends over \\nthe \\nmedium\\n-\\n \\nto longer\\n-\\nterm scenarios and forecasts \\n \\nSetting strategies at \\na \\ncorporat\\ne\\n \\nlevel and policies at \\na \\ngovernment level is not sufficient \\nto reach efficiency objectives. Transition to \\na \\nlower carbon intensity \\nworld also \\nrequires \\nthe \\nimplementation a\\nnd monitoring of plans. To do so, governments and firms should \\ncontinuously evaluat\\ne\\n \\nthe \\nimplementation framework of the \\nmedium\\n-\\n \\nto longer\\n-\\nterm \\nscenarios\\n \\nfor their\\n \\nenergy strategy\\n.\\n \\nFor instance, due to technological advancements\\n,\\n \\nthe whole building cycle of an LNG \\nproject used to be five to six years; currently, many projects are \\nnow \\ncompleted in three \\nto four years. In addition, the planning and construction timelines for gas fields, \\ninfrastructure and LNG carriers have all been \\nreduced.\\n \\nMoreover, digitalization is a new trend that is reshaping the energy environment and \\nenabling ongoing energy efficiency gains. It is suggested that digitization, in all its forms, \\n \\n262\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nshould be addressed as part of policy development in order to provi\\nde a tangible gain \\nto the system and its players. Digital innovations provide new perspectives on current \\nenergy efficiency issues and outstanding solutions to them, as well as completely new \\nopportunities to \\npush\\n \\nenergy efficiency to the next level by imp\\nroving the regulatory and \\npolicy environment, data analytics and stakeholder interconnection across all energy \\nsectors \\n\\n \\nfrom generation to distribution.\\n \\n \\nTo develop and intensify the technological momentum\\n \\nTechnology can speed up the progress toward energy\\n \\nefficiency. Establishing a low\\n-\\ncarbon future necessitates both carbon avoidance and carbon disposal. For instance, \\nCCS/CCUS are a technique that captures carbon emissions at a source location, \\ntransports them and injects them deep underground into a secur\\ne, approved geographic \\nsite for long\\n-\\nterm storage. Indeed, this is a business opportunity for oil and gas \\nproducers, who can use their subsurface reservoirs and expertise to offer safe CO\\n2\\n \\ndisposal as a service.\\n \\nThese technologies have the potential to sig\\nnificantly cut the CO\\n2\\n \\nemissions in energy \\nsystems. CCS\\n-\\nequipped facilities can collect nearly all the CO\\n2\\n \\nemissions they generate \\n(up to 90\\n%\\n \\nor even 100\\n%\\n). This explanation offers an overview of CCS/CCUS \\ntechnologies, and about how it works, where it is b\\neing utili\\ns\\ned, hurdles to wider use, \\nand regulations that may influence \\ntheir\\n \\ndevelopment and implementation.\\n \\nAs a result\\n,\\n \\nthis is not only a technological advancement that benefits the environment \\nbut also a business opportunity for oil and gas corporatio\\nns, which \\ncould\\n \\noffer safe CO\\n2\\n \\nremoval as a service by utilizing their deep reservoirs and expertise. Most of the \\nresearch in this field has concentrated on specific components of the CCS/CCUS value \\nchain, as well as legislation and regulation, but we thin\\nk that CCS/CCUS is the real, \\nsustainable answer. However, it should be note\\nd\\n \\nthat the Member Countries should \\nencourage policy mechanisms, such as carbon taxes, that reward CCS/CCUS as well. \\n \\n \\nTo invest in carbon\\n-\\nneutral or green LNG\\n \\nThe carbon\\n-\\nneutral or g\\nreen LNG market is an emerging prospect in which \\n\\ngreen\\n\\n \\nrefers \\nto either the lowering or offse\\nt\\nt\\ning\\n \\nof GHG emissions associated with some or all \\ncomponents of the LNG value chain \\n-\\n \\nfrom upstream gas production and pipeline \\ntransportation to liquefaction, \\ntransportation, regasification and downstream usage of \\nnatural gas. GHG emissions may be reduced in a variety of ways by companies in the \\nLNG value chain. For instance:\\n \\no\\n \\nUsing biogas as feedstock,\\n \\no\\n \\nDecreasing emissions from upstream, pipeline and liquefactio\\nn facilities,\\n \\no\\n \\nApplying renewable energy to power the liquefaction plants,\\n \\n \\n263\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\no\\n \\nUsing CCS/CCUS technologies to reinject the CO\\n2\\n \\ninto the subsurface after it had \\nbeen detained during the processing of the feed gas before liquefaction\\n \\nAs a result, it should be not\\ned that carbon\\n-\\nneutral does not imply that the LNG cargo \\nemits zero emissions; rather, LNG sellers can offset their GHG emissions by obtaining \\noffsets to compensate for all or a portion of their GHG emissions or by utilizing carbon \\ncredits, which support r\\neforestation, afforestation or other green projects. Carbon\\n-\\nneutral LNG can assist \\nin \\nguarantee\\ning\\n \\nthat natural gas continues to play an important \\nrole in the energy mix, therefore helping climate goals during the energy transition era\\n \\n(8).\\n \\n \\nTo invest in bl\\nue hydrogen \\n \\nAs the world continues to strive for a zero\\n-\\n \\nor negative\\n-\\ncarbon energy system, \\nhydrogen\\n\\ns role becomes more visible. The dominance of hydrogen revolves around its \\nability to decarboni\\ns\\ne so\\n-\\ncalled hard\\n-\\nto\\n-\\nabate sectors or sectors in which alter\\nnative \\ndecarboni\\ns\\nation paths, such as electrification, are opposed.\\n \\nAlmost all of the scenarios created by various organi\\ns\\nations predicted that hydrogen \\nwould\\n \\nincrease its \\nshare\\n \\nof energy consumption and that there \\nwould\\n \\nbe considerably \\nmore demand for \\nhydrogen in future years.\\n \\nWithout a doubt, natural gas will contribute to a portion of hydrogen generation via \\nmature pathways, such as blue hydrogen, or emerging technologies, such as pyrolysis \\n(also known as turquoise)\\n \\nhydrogen. \\nPolicies and strategies r\\nelated to the development \\nand implementation of these technologies in countries with vast gas resources and \\ncompetitive extraction costs, will deeply impact the role of natural gas in its contribution \\nto future hydrogen generation. \\n \\nNatural gas has a highl\\ny promising future role in hydrogen generation if the necessary \\nmethods are implemented and enough investments are made at the appropriate time.\\n \\nThe creation of a unified infrastructure is critical to the successful commerciali\\ns\\nation of \\nhydrogen. This is d\\nependent on significant collaboration across industries and nations, \\nas the process\\n \\nis extremely capital intensive and necessitates massive investments in \\ntechnology deployment, amounting to up to \\nUSD \\n15\\n \\ntn by 2050.\\n \\nThe cost of blue hydrogen is heavily rel\\niant on the cost of natural gas feedstock and \\ncarbon capture expenses, which range from \\nUSD \\n1.5\\n-\\n2.9/kg of hydrogen owing to \\ndifferences in carbon sequestration and natural gas production prices.\\n \\nThe GECF Member nations are privileged to profit from the low\\nest cost of natural gas \\nproduction and the \\nenormous\\n \\npotential of CCS/CCUS, lowering the overall cost of blue \\nhydrogen in these countries to between \\nUSD \\n1\\n-\\n1.5\\n/\\nkg of hydrogen by 2050, depending \\n \\n264\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\non the size of deployment. As a result, if seized at the appropr\\niate moment, blue \\nhydrogen might be a wonderful opportunity for GECF countries.\\n \\n \\nTo invest in blue ammonia\\n \\nGas producers perceive natural gas as a vector of the energy transition, notably \\nhydrogen and thus in order to achieve long\\n-\\nterm emission\\ns\\n \\nreduction t\\nargets, they have \\nbegun to consider hydrogen as crucial fuel for sustainable global deca\\nrbonis\\nation. In \\nthis regard, blue ammonia has also emerged as a prominent feedstock to boost a low\\n-\\ncarbon economy.\\n \\nCurrently, ammonia enjoys the advantages of an existi\\nng broad user base as it is the \\nbasis of fertilizer production. \\nAdditionally,\\n \\nthere is a\\n \\nwell\\n-\\ndeveloped infrastructure\\n,\\n \\nand \\nlarge\\n-\\nscale ammonia production facilities are available around the world, making its \\nproduction more feasible.\\n \\nFurthermore, recent a\\ndvances in turbine engine technologies have led to the increased \\nuse of ammonia, either directly for combustion or indirectly by reforming it back into \\nnitrogen and hydrogen as an industrial feedstock.\\n \\nCompared to hydrogen, ammonia does not require cooling\\n \\nto extreme temperatures and \\nalso \\nhas\\n \\na higher energy density than liquid hydrogen, making it more efficient to \\ntransport and store. In contrast, a significant challenge for hydrogen is the high cost of \\nstoring systems, the purity requirement and transport\\nation.\\n \\nThese advantages suggest that ammonia could \\neasily\\n \\nbe a competitive option as a \\nsolution for decarboni\\ns\\ning energy\\n-\\nintensive industr\\nies\\n, particularly in the power \\ngeneration and transport sectors. The GECF Member Countries, as the pivot of natural \\nga\\ns producers in the world, can penetrate blue ammonia markets for two reasons. First, \\nthey can benefit from\\n \\ntheir\\n \\nvast natural gas resources in producing blue ammonia, which \\nprovides them with a competitive position in supplying global demand. Second\\nly\\n, the\\ny \\ncan leverage blue ammonia production as one of the carbon reduction policies in \\ncontributing to the low\\n-\\ncarbon global economy\\n \\n(9)\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n265\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nAnnex I: \\nD\\nemographic, economic & energy price assumptions\\n \\n \\n2021 Reference Case\\n \\n \\n \\n2020\\n \\n2030\\n \\n2040\\n \\n2050\\n \\n2020 \\n-\\n \\n2050\\n \\nPopulation, million people\\n \\n7,791\\n \\n8,544\\n \\n9,194\\n \\n9,731\\n \\n1,939\\n \\nUrbanisation rate, % of \\nurban in total population\\n \\n56%\\n \\n61%\\n \\n65%\\n \\n69%\\n \\n \\n \\nNumber of households \\n \\n2,204\\n \\n2,486\\n \\n2,749\\n \\n3,018\\n \\n \\n \\nReal GDP, trillion USD\\n \\n84\\n \\n117\\n \\n154\\n \\n198\\n \\n114\\n \\nOil Brent Price, USD\\n \\n41\\n \\n60\\n \\n60\\n \\n60\\n \\n \\n \\nCarbon prices EU ETS, \\nper ton in 2020 USD\\n \\n28\\n \\n59\\n \\n70\\n \\n74\\n \\n \\n \\nCarbon prices US ETS, \\nper ton in 2020 USD\\n \\n3\\n \\n10\\n \\n26\\n \\n42\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2020\\n-\\n2030\\n \\n2031\\n-\\n2040\\n \\n2041\\n-\\n2050\\n \\n \\n \\n2020 \\n-\\n \\n2050\\n \\nGlobal population, annual \\ngrowth rates\\n \\n0.9%\\n \\n0.7%\\n \\n0.6%\\n \\n \\n \\n0.8%\\n \\nReal global GDP \\ngrowth \\nrate\\n \\n3.0%\\n \\n2.8%\\n \\n2.6%\\n \\n \\n \\n2.8%\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n266\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\nAnnex II\\n: \\nPolicy assumptions\\n \\n \\n \\nEuropean Union\\n \\nPolicy \\ndomain\\n \\nMain policy drivers and assumptions\\n \\nGlobal energy \\nand climate \\npolicies\\n \\n \\n \\nClimate targets:\\n \\nAdoption of new \\ncollective \\nemissions reduction targets \\nin the \\nframework of the Green Deal Agenda \\n(\\n-\\n55% by 2030/1990; carbon neutrality by \\n2050)\\n.\\n \\n \\n\\ned Member States (MS) \\ndecarbonis\\nation efforts.\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\nEnergy integration strategy: Policy efforts to incentivize electrification, efficiency \\nand circular economy. \\n \\n \\nImplementation of final NECPs: National targets, published in 2020, are met or \\nover\\n-\\nachieved in a large part of the EU MS.

Typically, \\ncondensate, oil, bitumen, and synthetic crude barrels are taken to be \\nequal (1 bbl = 1 BOE). Gas and NGL qua\\nntities are converted to an oil \\nequivalent based on a conversion factor that is recommended to be \\nbased on a nominal heating content or calorific value equivalent to a \\nbarrel of oil. \\n \\n \\nBiofuels\\n \\nLiquid fuels derived from biomass or waste feedstocks, includ\\ning ethanol \\nand biodiesel. \\n \\n \\nBiomass and \\nwaste\\n \\nRenewable organic materials, such as wood, agricultural crops or \\nwastes, and municipal wastes, especially when used as a source of fuel \\nor energy. Biomass can be burned directly or processed into biofuels \\nsuc\\nh as ethanol and methane.\\n \\n \\nBunkers\\n \\nIncludes both international marine bunkers and international aviation \\nbunkers. \\n \\n \\nCoal\\n \\nIncludes primary coal (hard coal, lignite, coking\\n \\nand steam coal) and \\nderived fuels (including patent fuel, brown coal briquettes, \\ncoke oven \\ncoke, gas coke, gas\\n-\\nworks gas, coke\\n-\\noven gas, blast\\n-\\nfurnace gas and \\noxygen steel furnace gas). Peat is also included.\\n \\n \\n \\nCoalbed methane\\n \\nNatural gas contained in coal deposits. Coalbed gas, although usually \\nmostly methane, may be produced with va\\nriable amounts of inert or even \\nnon\\n-\\ninert gases. [Also called coal\\n-\\nseam gas or natural gas from coal.]\\n \\n \\nCondensate\\n \\nA mixture of hydrocarbons (mainly pentanes and heavier) that exist in \\nthe gaseous phase at original temperature and pressure of the reservoi\\nr, \\nbut when produced, are in the liquid phase at surface pressure and \\ntemperature conditions. Condensate differs from NGLs in two respects: \\n(1) NGL is extracted and recovered in gas plants rather than lease \\nseparators or other lease facilities, and (2) NGL\\n \\nincludes very light \\nhydrocarbons (ethane, propane or butanes) as well as the pentanes\\n-\\nplus \\nthat are the main constituents of condensate.\\n \\n \\nContracts for \\nDifference\\n \\nA mechanism of hedging the price of electricity for renewables between \\nrenewable generators\\n \\nand counter parties (for instance\\n \\nthe\\n \\nLow Carbon \\nContracts Company in the UK). It allows the generators to receive a pre\\n-\\nagreed level for the duration of contracts (the strike price). Under this \\nmechanism, when the market price for electricity generated (\\nthe \\nreference price) is below the strike price agreed in the contract, \\ncompensation is paid by the counter party. On the other side, when the \\nreference price is above the strike price, the renewable generator pays \\nthe counterpart. \\n \\n \\n288\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nConventional \\nresources\\n \\nResources that exist in porous and permeable rock with buoyancy \\npressure equilibrium. The petroleum initially in place is trapped in \\ndiscrete accumulations related to a localized geological structural feature \\nand/or stratigraphic condition, typically with\\n \\neach accumulation bounded \\nby a down dip contact with an aquifer, and is significantly affected by \\nhydrodynamic influences such as buoyancy of petroleum in water.\\n \\n \\nCost tranche\\n \\nA set of production entities grouped according to a defined cost range.\\n \\n \\nCurt\\nailment\\n \\nAccording to National Renewable Energy Laboratory, curtailment is a \\nreduction in the output of a generator of variable renewable energy from \\nwhat it could otherwise produce given available resources like wind or \\nsunlight. Variable renewable energy \\ncurtailment is usually used as a way \\nto reduce the production of energy that cannot be delivered due to lack \\nof power system flexibility.\\n \\n \\nDecommissioned \\nLNG project\\n \\n \\nProject is officially announced by owner as decommissioned \\n(mothballed) or has been inac\\ntive for a significant period of time.\\n \\nDistributed \\nenergy system\\n \\nInclude\\ns\\n \\nsystems which generate and deliver energy services (Power, \\ncooking or heating services) independent of centralised systems. For \\nrenewable power, they include particularly off grid r\\nenewable generators \\nsuch as home solar panels. \\n \\n \\nDomestic\\n \\nThe domestic sector includes energy used in the residential, commercial \\nand agricultural sectors. Domestic energy use includes space heating \\nand cooling, water heating, lighting, appliances and cooking equipment. \\n \\n \\nDry gas\\n \\nNatural gas remaining after \\nhydrocarbon liquids have been removed \\nbefore the reference point. It should be recognized that this is a \\nresources assessment definition and not a phase behaviour definition. \\n(Also called lean gas.)\\n \\n \\nElectricity \\ngeneration\\n \\nDefined as the total amount of e\\nlectricity generated by power only or \\ncombined heat and power plants including generation required for own\\n \\nuse. This is also referred to as gross generation. \\n \\n \\nEnergy sector\\n \\nCovers the use of energy by non\\n-\\nenergy sector and the energy losses in \\nconverting\\n \\nprimary energy into a form that can be used in the final \\nconsumption sectors. It includes losses by gas works, petroleum \\nrefineries, blast furnaces, coke ovens, coal and gas transformation and \\nliquefaction. It also includes energy used in the distribution\\n \\nnetwork. \\nTransfers and statistical differences are also included in this category. \\n \\n \\nEnhanced oil \\nrecovery (EOR)\\n \\nThe extraction of additional petroleum, beyond primary recovery, from \\nnaturally occurring reservoirs by supplementing the natural forces in the \\nreservoir. It includes \\nwater flooding\\n \\nand gas injection for pressure \\nmaintenance, secondary processes, tertiary \\nprocesses, and any other \\nmeans of supplementing natural reservoir recovery processes. Improved \\nrecovery also includes thermal and chemical processes to improve the \\n \\n289\\n \\n \\nGECF\\n \\nGlobal Gas Outlook\\n \\n2050\\n \\n \\nin\\n-\\nsitu mobility of viscous forms of petroleum. (Also called improved \\nrecovery.)\\n \\n \\nExisting \\ngas \\nproduction \\nfacilities\\n \\nThose that are in production as of 2020.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nExisting LNG \\nproject\\n \\n \\nExisting capacity that has reached commercial start\\n-\\nup.
