However, for the second \\nyear in a row, the International Energy Agency (IEA) is releasing our flagship report a month \\nearly, in October. We did this last year because it was an exceptional year defined by the \\n\\nCovid\\n-19 cri\\nsis. This year is another exceptional year because of the COP26 Climate Change \\nConference meeting in Glasgow.\\n This COP \\nŒ \\nshort for \\nthe\\n Conference\\n of the Parties, the\\n main\\n decision\\n-making body\\n of the \\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Chang\\ne Œ i\\ns particularly significant. It is \\nthe first test of the readiness of countries to submit new and more ambitious commitments \\n\\nunder the 2015 Paris Agreement. It is also an opportunity \\nŒ \\nas the \\nWEO\\n-2021\\n states \\nŒ \\nto \\nprovide an ﬁunmistakeable signalﬂ that accelerates the transition to clean energy worldwide. \\n This year™s edition of the \\nWEO\\n has been designed, exceptionally, as a guidebook to COP26. \\nIt spells out clearly what is at stake \\nŒ what the pledges to reduce emissions made by \\ngovernments so far mean for the energy sector and the climate. And it makes clear what \\nmore needs to be done to move beyond these announced pledges towards a pathway that \\nwould have a good chance of limiting global warming to 1.5\\n °\\nC and avoiding the worst effects \\nof climate change. \\n Fo\\nr this, the analysis in \\nWEO\\n-2021\\n relies on our landmark report published earlier this year \\nŒ \\nNet Zero by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global Energy Sector\\n Œ \\nwhich is now an integral part of \\nthe pioneering energy modelling work that goes into producing the \\nWEO\\n e\\nach year.\\n The IEA™s work this year has demonstrated our commitment to leading clean energy \\n\\ntransitions globally by enabling governments to understand what they need to do to put \\n\\nemissions into rapid and sustained decline. But we have also made very clear t\\nhat countries™ \\ntransitions have to be secure, affordable and fair for all citizens. If governments do not \\n\\nensure that these key elements are at the core of their policy\\n making for the transformation \\nof their energy sectors, then they risk failure.\\n At the t\\nime of publication of this year™s \\nWEO\\n, governments are getting an advanced warning \\nof this risk, with the prices of natural gas, coal and electricity rising to all\\n-time highs in many \\nregions. The \\nkey \\nreasons for these sharp increases in energy prices are n\\not related to efforts \\nto transition to clean energy. They include a rapid economic rebound from last year™s \\n\\npandemic\\n-induced recession, weather\\n-related factors, and some planned and unplanned \\noutages on the supply side. \\n However, that does not mean clean energy transitions in the years ahead will be free from \\nvolatility. The current context underscores the value of the special analysis \\nthat \\nwe carried \\nout for \\nWEO\\n-2021\\n on energy security risks in transitions. \\nThis analysis\\n highlights the potential \\nvulnerabil\\nities that need to be on the radar screens of politicians and other decision\\n makers \\nas the world navigates this essential but deeply challenging era of change for our energy \\n\\nsystems. \\n  4 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n  Successful transitions must be secure, or they will not happen fast enou\\ngh to ward off \\ncatastrophic climate change. And they must have people at their centre, as the IEA has \\nemphasised through the work of the Global Commission on People\\n-Centred Clean Energy \\nTransitions, which I convened in early 2021. Headed by Danish Prime Mi\\nni\\nster \\nMette\\n Frederiksen\\n, the Global Commission brings together \\nnational leaders, government \\nministers, civil society representatives and other prominent figures\\n to identify\\n how to ensure \\nthat the transition to clean energy is fair and inclusive for everyo\\nne\\n. It will publish its \\nrecommendations ahead of the start of COP26 at the end of October 2021.\\n As always with the energy sector, investment is critical. The IEA has been warning for years \\n\\nthat current investment levels in the global energy sector are inad\\nequate \\nŒ \\nboth to meet \\nnear\\n-term energy needs and long\\n-term transition goals. It is hard to understate the dangers \\ninherent in today™s shortfall in spending on clean energy transitions, compared with the \\n\\nlevels required. If we do not correct it soon, the ri\\nsks of destabilising volatility will only grow \\nas we move forward.\\n Reaching the critical but formidable goal of net zero emissions by 2050 will require major \\n\\nefforts from across society \\nŒ \\nbut it also offers major advantages in terms of human health \\nand economic development. What comes through very clearly in this new \\nWEO\\n are the huge \\nopportunities that come with clean energy transitions \\nŒ \\nfor manufacturers of wind turbines, \\nbatteries, electrolysers and a host of other technologies. A new global energy economy is \\nemerging, with the potential to create millions of decent jobs across a host of new supply \\nchains. T\\no make this a reality, government leaders\\n in Glasgow must play their part by making \\nthe 2020s a decade of massive clean energy deployment.\\n Finally, I would like to thank the truly exceptional work \\nŒ \\nin \\nextremely chal\\nlenging times\\n Œ \\nby \\nthe team of IEA colleagues who worked so hard and so effectively on this \\nWEO\\n under the \\noutstanding leadership of\\n my colleagues\\n Laura Cozzi and Tim Gould.\\n   Dr Fatih Birol\\n Executive Director\\n International Energy Agency\\n  Acknowledgements\\n 5  Acknowledgements\\n This study was prepared by the World Energy Outlook (WEO) team in the Directorate of \\nSustainability, Technology and Outlooks (STO) in co\\n-operation with other directorates and \\noffices of the International Energy Agency.

Its emergence is the product of a virtuous circle of policy action \\nand technology innovation, and its momentum \\nis now sustained by lower costs. In most \\nmarkets\\n, solar PV or wind now represents the cheapest available source of new electricity \\ngeneration. \\nClean energy technology is becoming a major new area for investment and \\nemployment \\nŒ \\nand a dynamic arena for international collaboration and competition. \\n –but the transformation still has a long way to go\\n At the moment, however, every data point showing the speed of change in energy can be \\n\\ncountered by another showing the \\nstubbornness\\n of the status quo. \\nThe rapid bu\\nt \\nuneven \\neconomic \\nrecovery\\n from last year™s Covid\\n-induced recession\\n is putting major strains on parts \\nof today™s energy system, sparking sharp price rises in natural gas, coal and electricity \\n\\nmarkets. \\nFor all the advances being made by renewables and elect\\nric mobility, 2021 \\nis seeing \\na large rebound in coal and oil use.\\n L\\nargely for this reason, it is also seeing\\n the second\\n-largest \\nannual increase in CO\\n2 emissions in history. Public spending on sustainable energy in \\neconomic recovery packages has \\nonly mobili\\nsed around one\\n-third\\n of the \\ninvestment\\n required \\nto jolt the energy system onto a new set of rails, with the largest shortfall in developing \\neconomies that continue to face a pressing public health crisis. Progress towards universal \\nenergy \\naccess has \\nstalle\\nd, especially in sub\\n-Saharan Africa. The direction of travel is a long \\nway from alignment with the IEA™s landmark \\nNet Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario\\n (NZE), \\npublished in May 2021, which charts a narrow but achievable roadmap to a \\n1.5 \\n°C \\nstabilisation in \\nrising global temperatures and the achievement of other energy\\n-related \\nsustainable development goals.\\n At a pivotal moment for energy and climate, the WEO\\n-2021 provides an \\nessential guidebook for COP26 and beyond\\n Pressures on the energy system are not going\\n to relent in the coming decades.\\n The energy \\nsector is responsible for almost three\\n-quarters of the emissions that have already pushed \\nglobal average temperatures \\n1.1 \\n°C higher since the pre\\n-industrial age, with visible impacts \\non weather and climate extre\\nmes. The energy sector has to be at the heart of the solution \\nto climate change. At the same time, modern energy is inseparable from the livelihoods and \\naspirations of a global population that is set to grow by some 2\\n billion people to 2050, with \\nrising in\\ncomes pushing up demand for energy services, and many developing economies \\nnavigating what has historically been an \\nenergy\\n- \\nand emissions\\n-intensive period of \\nurbanisation and industrialisation. Today™s energy system is not capable of meeting these \\nchalleng\\nes; a low emissions revolution is long overdue. \\n  16 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  This special edition of the \\nWorld Energy Outlook\\n has been designed to assist decision\\n makers at the 26th Conference of the Parties \\n(COP26) and beyond by describing the key \\ndecision points that can move the energy sector onto safer ground. \\nIt provides a detailed \\nstocktake of \\nhow far countries have come in their clean energy transitions, how far they still \\nhave to go to reach the \\n1.5 \\n°C goal, \\nand the actions that governments and others can take to \\nseize opportunities and avoid pitfalls along the way. With multiple scenarios and case \\nstudies, this \\nWEO\\n explains what is at stake, at a time when informed debate on energy and \\nclimate is more important than ever.\\n Announced climate pledges move the needle–\\n In the run\\n-u\\np to COP26, \\nmany \\ncountries have put new commitments on the table, detailing \\ntheir contributions to the global effort to reach climate goals; more than 50 countries\\n, a\\ns well as\\n the\\n entire\\n European Union\\n, \\nhave pledged to meet net zero emissions targets\\n. If \\nthese are implemented in time and in full, as modelled in detail in our new \\nAnnounced \\nPledges Scenario \\n(APS), they start to bend the global emissions curve down. Over the period \\n\\nto 2030, low emissions sources of power generation account for the vast majorit\\ny of capacity \\nadditions in this scenario, with annual additions of solar PV and wind approaching \\n\\n500 \\ngigawatts (GW) by 2030. As a result, coal consumption in the power sector in 2030 is \\n20% below \\nrecent highs. Rapid growth in electric vehicle sales and continued improvements\\n in fuel efficiency lead to a peak in oil demand\\n around 2025\\n. Efficiency gains mean that global \\nenergy demand plateaus post\\n-2030. The successful pursuit of all announced pledges means \\nthat global \\nenergy\\n-related \\nCO\\n2 emissions fall by 4\\n0% over the period to 2050\\n. All sectors see \\na decline, with the electricity sector delivering by far the largest. The global average \\n\\ntemperature rise in 2100 is held to around 2.1\\n °C above pre\\n-industrial levels, although this \\nscenario does not hit net zero\\n emissions\\n, \\nso the temperature trend has still not stabilised.\\n –but achieving these pledges in full and on time cannot be taken for granted\\n A lot more needs to be done by governments to fully deliver on the\\nir\\n announced pledges\\n. Looking sector\\n-by\\n-sector at \\nwhat\\n measures\\n governments have actually\\n put in place, as well \\nas specific policy initiatives that are under development, reveals a different picture\\n, which is \\ndepicted in our \\nStated Policies Scenario\\n (STEPS). This scenario also sees an accelerating pace \\nof\\n change in the power sector, sufficient to realise a gradual decline in the sector™s emissions \\neven as global electricity demand \\nnearly\\n doubles to 2050. However, this is offset by \\ncontinued growth in emissions from industry, such as\\n the\\n production of cemen\\nt and steel, \\nand heavy\\n-duty transport\\n, \\nsuch as freight trucks. This growth largely comes from emerging \\nmarket \\nand developing economies as they build up their nationwide\\n infrastructure. In the \\nSTEPS, \\nalmost \\nall of the net growth in energy demand to 2050 is \\nmet by low emissions \\nsources, but that leaves annual emissions at around current levels. As a result, global average \\n\\ntemperatures are still rising when they hit 2.6\\n °C above pre\\n-industrial levels in 2100.\\n    Executive Summary\\n  \\n17  Today™s pledges cover less than 20% of the gap in\\n emissions reductions that \\nneeds to be closed by 2030 to keep a 1.5\\n °C path within reach\\n The APS sees a doubling of clean energy\\n investment and financing over the next decade, \\nbut this acceleration is not sufficient to overcome the inertia of today™s energy system\\n. In \\nparticular, over \\nthe\\n crucial \\nperiod to 2030\\n, the actions in this scenario fall well short of \\nthe \\nemissions reductions that would be\\n requir\\ned to keep the door open to a Net Zero \\nEmissions \\nby 2050 trajectory. One of the key reasons for this shortfall is that today™s climate \\n\\ncommitments, as reflected in the APS, reveal sharp divergences between countries in the \\npledged \\nspeeds of their energy transitions. Alongside \\nits\\n achievements, this scenario also \\ncontains the seeds of new divisions and tensions, in the areas of trade in energy\\n-intensive \\ngoods,\\n for example\\n, \\nor in international investment and finance. Successful, orderly\\n and \\nbroad\\n-based\\n energy\\n transitions depend on finding ways to lessen the tensions in the \\ninternational system that are highlighted in the APS\\n. A\\nll countries will need to do more to \\nalign and strengthen their 2030 goals and \\nmake this a collaborative\\n global\\n transition in which \\nno one is left behind.\\n  \\nSolutions to close the gap with a 1.5\\n °C path are available \\nŒ \\nand many are \\nhighly cost\\n-effective \\n The \\nWEO\\n-2021\\n highlights four key measures that can help to close the gap between today™s \\npledges and a 1.5\\n °C \\ntrajectory over the next ten years\\n Œ \\nand to underpin further emissions \\nreductions post\\n-2030.\\n More than 40% of the actions required are cost\\n-effective, meaning \\nthat they result in overall cost savings to consumers compared with the pathway in the APS. \\nAll c\\nountries need to do more\\n: \\nthose with existing net zero pledges account for about half of \\nthe additional reductions, \\nnotably China\\n. The four measures are:\\n  A massive \\nadditional push for clean electrification\\n that requires a doubling of solar PV \\nand wind depl\\noyment relative to the APS\\n; a major expansion of other low\\n-emissions \\ngeneration, including the use of nuclear power where acceptable; a huge build\\n-out of \\nelectricity infrastructure and all forms of system flexibility, including from hydropower; \\n\\na rapid pha\\nse out of coal;\\n and a drive to expand electricity use for transport and heating. \\nAccelerating the decarbonisation of the electricity mix is the single most important lever \\navailable to policy makers: it closes more than one\\n-third of the emissions gap betwe\\nen \\nthe APS and NZE. With \\nimproved power market designs and other enabling conditions, \\nthe low costs of wind and solar PV mean that more than half of the additional emissions \\n\\nreductions could be gained at no cost to electricity consumers\\n. \\n A relentless \\nfocus\\n on energy efficiency\\n, together with measures to temper energy \\nservice demand through material\\ns \\nefficiency and behavioural change. T\\nhe energy \\nintensity of the global economy decreases by more than \\n4% per year between 2020 and \\n\\n2030 in the NZE\\n Œ \\nmore than double the average rate of the previous decade. Without \\nthis improvement in energy intensity, total final \\nenergy \\nconsumption in the NZE would \\nbe about \\none\\n-third higher in 2030, significantly increasing the cost and difficulty of \\ndecarbonising energy supply. \\nWe estimate\\n that\\n almost 8\\n0% of the additional energy \\nefficiency gains in the NZE over the next decade result in cost savings to consumers\\n. \\n 18 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n   A broad \\ndrive to cut methane emissions from fossil fuel operations. \\nRapid reductions \\nin methane emissions are a key t\\nool to limit near\\n-term global warming, and the most \\ncost\\n-effective abatement opportunities are in the energy sector, particularly in oil and \\ngas operations. Methane abatement is not addressed quickly or effectively enough by \\nsimply \\nreducing\\n fossil fuel use\\n; concerted efforts from governments and industry are \\nvital to secure the emissions cuts that close \\nnearly \\n15% \\nof the gap to the NZE.\\n  A big \\nboost to clean energy innovation\\n. T\\nhis is another crucial gap to be filled in the \\n2020s, even though most of the impacts on emissions are not felt until later. \\nAll the \\ntechnologies needed to achieve deep emissions cuts to 2030 are available. But a\\nlmost\\n half of the emissions reductions achie\\nved in the NZE in 2050 come from technologies \\nthat today are at the demonstration or prototype stage. These are particularly important \\n\\nto address emissions from iron and steel, cement and other energy\\n-intensive\\n industrial\\n sector\\ns Œ \\nand\\n also from\\n long\\n-dista\\nnce transport. Today™s announced pledges fall short \\nof key NZE milestones \\nfor\\n the deployment of hydrogen\\n-based and other low\\n-carbon \\nfuels, as well as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). \\n Finance is the missing link to accelerate clean energy de\\nployment in \\ndeveloping economies\\n Getting the world on track for \\n1.5 °C \\nrequires\\n a surge in annual \\ninvestment \\nin clean energy \\nprojects and infrastructure \\nto \\nnearly USD\\n 4 trillion by 2030\\n. Some 70% of the additional \\nspending required to close the gap between\\n the APS and NZE is needed in emerging \\nmarket \\nand developing economies.\\n There have been some notable examples\\n of \\ndeveloping \\neconom\\nies mobilising capital for clean energy projects, such as India™s success in financing a \\nrapid expansion of solar PV in pursuit of its 450\\n GW target for renewables by 2030. However, \\nthere have also been persistent challenges, many of which \\nhave been\\n exacer\\nbated by the \\npandemic. \\nFunds to support sustainable economic recovery are scarce and capital remains \\nup to seven\\n-times more expensive than in advanced economies.\\n In some of the poorest \\ncountries in the world, Covid\\n-19 also broke\\n the trend of steady progres\\ns towards \\nuniversal \\naccess to electricity and clean cooking\\n. T\\nhe number of people without access to electricity is \\nset to rise by 2% in 2021, with almost all of the \\nincrease in sub\\n-Saharan Africa.\\n An international catalyst is essential to accelerate flows \\nof capital \\nin support of energy \\ntransitions and allow developing economies to chart a new lower emissions path for \\n\\ndevelopment\\n. Most transition\\n-related energy investment will need to be carried out by \\nprivate developers, consumers and financiers responding\\n to market signals and policies set \\nby governments. Alongside the necessary policy and regulatory reforms, public financial \\n\\ninstitutions\\n Œ \\nled by international development banks and larger climate finance \\ncommitments from advanced economies\\n Œ \\nplay crucial \\nroles to bring forward investment in \\nareas where private players do not yet see the right balance of risk and reward. \\n    Executive Summary\\n  \\n19  Strategies to phase out coal have to effectively deal with impacts on jobs and \\nelectricity security \\n Coal demand declines in all our scenarios, but the difference between the 10% decline to \\n2030 in APS and the 55% decline in NZE is the speed at which coal is phased out from the \\n\\npower sector.\\n This has four components: halting the approval of new, unabated coal plants; \\nreducing emissions fr\\nom the 2\\n 100 \\nGW of operating plants, which produced more than \\none\\n-third\\n of the world™s electricity in 2020; investing \\nŒ \\nat sufficient scale \\nŒ \\nto reliably meet the \\ndemand that would otherwise have been met by coal; and managing the economic and social \\nconse\\nquences of change. Approvals of new coal\\n-fired plants have slowed dramatically in \\nrecent years, stemmed by lower\\n cost renewable energy alternatives, rising awareness of \\nenvironmental risks, and increasingly scarce options for financing. Yet some 140\\n GW of \\nnew \\ncoal plants are \\ncurrently \\nunder construction and more than 400\\n GW are at various stages of \\nplanning. China™s announcement of an end to support for building coal plants abroad is \\npotentially very significant: it could lead to the cancellation of up to 1\\n90 \\nGW of coal projects \\nthat are built in the APS. This could save \\nsome\\n 20 \\ngigatonnes in cumulative\\n CO2 emissions if \\nthese plants are replaced with low emissions generation\\n Œ \\nan amount comparable to the \\ntotal \\nemissions saving\\ns \\nfrom the European Union going \\nto net zero by 2050.\\n Bringing down emissions from the existing\\n global\\n coal fleet requires a broad\\n-based and \\ndedicated policy effort. \\nIn our scenarios, \\ncoal \\nplants are either retrofitted with CCUS\\n, reconfigured to be\\n co-fired with low emissions fuels such a\\ns biomass or ammonia, \\nrepurposed to focus on system adequacy, or retired. Retirements in the APS occur at twice \\n\\nthe rate seen in the last decade\\n, \\nand the rate nearly doubles again in the NZE to reach almost \\n100 \\nGW of retirements\\n per year. Policy interventions need to focus on retiring plants that \\nwould not otherwise have done so while\\n also\\n supporting measures to bring down emissions \\nfrom the remaining fleet.\\n Support must be there for those \\nwho\\n lose jobs in declining sectors. \\nManaging the phase\\n-out of coal d\\nepends on early and sustained engagement by governments and financial \\ninstitutions to mitigate the impacts on affected workers and communities, and \\nto \\nallow for \\nthe reclamation and repurposing of lands. Energy transitions create dislocations: many more \\nnew\\n jobs are created, but not necessarily in the same places where jobs are lost. Skill sets \\nare not automatically transferable, and new skills are needed. This is true \\nboth \\nwithin specific \\ncountries and internationally. Governments need to manage the impacts\\n carefully\\n, seeking \\ntransition pathways that maximise opportunities for decent, high quality work and for \\nworkers to make use of their existing skills\\n Œ \\nand mobilising long\\n-term support for affected \\nworkers and communities. \\n Liquids and gases are caught be\\ntween scenarios\\n Oil demand, for the first time, goes into eventual decline in all the scenarios examined in \\nthe \\nWEO\\n-2021\\n, although the timing and speed of the drop vary widely.\\n In the STEPS, the \\nhigh point in demand is reached in the \\nmid\\n-2030s and the decl\\nine is very gradual\\n. I\\nn the APS, \\na peak \\nsoon after 2025\\n is followed by a decline to\\nwards\\n 75 \\nmillion barrels per day (mb/d) by \\n 20 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  2050. T\\no meet the requirements of the NZE\\n, \\noil use plummets to 2\\n5 \\nmb/d by mid\\n-century. \\nNatural gas demand increases in all scenarios over the next five years, but there are sharp \\ndivergences after this. Many factors affect to what extent, and for how long, natural gas \\n\\nretains a place in various sectors as clean energy transitions accelerate\\n. T\\nhe outlook is far \\nfrom uniform across different countries and regions. In the NZE, a rapid rise in low emissions \\n\\nfuels is \\none of the key \\nreason\\ns Œ \\nalongside\\n greater\\n efficiency and electrification \\nŒ \\nwhy no new \\noil and gas fields are required beyond those already approved for development. \\nActual \\ndeployment \\nof low emissions fuels \\nis well \\noff\\n track\\n. For example,\\n despite the burgeoning \\ninterest in low\\n-carbon hydrogen\\n, t\\nhe pipeline of planned\\n hydrogen\\n projects falls short of the \\nlevels of use in 2030 implied by announced pledges, and even further short\\n of \\nthe amounts \\nrequired in the NZE (which are \\nnine\\n-times higher than in the APS).\\n There is a looming risk of more turbulence ahead for energy markets\\n  \\nThe world is not investing enough to meet its future energy needs, and uncertainties over \\npolicies and demand trajectories create a strong risk of a volatile period ahead for energy \\n\\nmarkets\\n. Transition\\n-related spending is gradually picking up, but remains far short of what is \\nrequired to meet rising demand for energy services in a sustainable way. The defici\\nt is visible \\nacross all sectors and regions. At the same time, the amount being spent on oil and natural \\n\\ngas, \\ndragg\\ned down by two price collapses in 2014\\n-15 and in 2020, \\nis geared towards a world \\nof stagnant or even falling demand for these fuels\\n. O\\nil and \\ngas spending\\n today\\n is one of the \\nvery few areas that it is reasonably well aligned with the levels seen in the NZE to 2030. \\nIEA \\n\\nanalysis has repeatedly highlighted that a surge in spending to boost deployment of clean \\nenergy technologies\\n and infrastructure\\n provides the way out of this impasse, but this needs \\nto \\nhappen\\n quickly or global energy markets will face a turbulent and volatile period ahead. \\nClear signals and direction from policy makers are essential\\n. I\\nf the road ahead is paved only \\nwith good intentions, then it will be a bumpy ride indeed.\\n Transitions can offer some shelter for consumers against oil and gas price \\nshocks\\n Energy transitions can\\n provide a\\n cushion\\n from the shock of commodity price spikes, if \\nconsumers can get help to manage the upfront \\ncosts of change\\n. In a \\ntransform\\ning energy \\nsystem\\n such as the NZE, households are less reliant on oil and gas to meet their energy needs, \\nthanks to efficiency improvements, a switch to electricity for mobility, and a move away from \\nfossil fuel\\n-fired boilers\\n for heating. For these reasons, a large commodity price shock in 2030 \\nis \\n30% less costly to households in the NZE compared with\\n in\\n the STEPS. Reaching this point \\nwill require policies that assist households with the additional upfront costs of efficiency \\n\\nimprovements \\nand low emissions equipment such as electric vehicles and heat pumps.\\n As electricity takes up a progressively larger share of household energy bills, governments \\nhave to ensure that electricity markets are resilient by incentivising investment\\ns in \\nflexibility, efficiency and demand\\n-side response. \\nAcross all scenarios\\n, \\nthe share of variable \\nrenewables in electricity generation expands to reach 40\\n-70% by 2050 (and even \\nhigher\\n in \\n Executive Summary\\n  \\n21  some regions), compared with an average of just under 10% today. In the NZE, there are \\nsome 240\\n million rooftop solar PV systems and 1.6\\n billion electric cars by 2050. Such a system \\nwill need to operate very flexibly, enabled by \\nadequate capacity, \\nrobust grids, battery storage \\nand dispatchable low emissions sources of \\nelectricity (like hydropower, geothermal and \\nbioenergy\\n, \\nas well as hydrogen and ammonia\\n-fired plants, or small modular nuclear \\nreactors)\\n. This kind of system will also require \\ndigital\\n technologies \\nthat can support demand\\n-side response and securely manage m\\nulti\\n-directional flows of data and energy.\\n Other potential \\nenergy security \\nvulnerabilities require close vigilance\\n Trade patterns, producer policies and geopolitical considerations \\nremain\\n cri\\ntic\\nally\\n importan\\nt \\nfor\\n energy security\\n, \\neven as the world shifts to an electrified, renewables\\n-rich \\nenergy system. \\nTh\\nis\\n relate\\ns \\nin part to the way that energy transitions affect oil and gas as \\nsuppl\\nies\\n become more concentrated in a smaller group of resource\\n-rich countries\\n Œ \\neven as \\ntheir economies simultaneously come under strain from lower export revenues.

It is designed to inform the \\nenergy and climate debates at the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties (COP26) in November \\n2021 and beyond. As such, it departs from the usual \\nWEO\\n structure in the way it organises \\nand presents the material and analyses. The \\nWEO\\n-2021\\n chapters are: \\n  Chapter\\n 1 provides an overview of key themes, drawing on material from the other \\nchapters and augmented with additional analysis.\\n  Chapter\\n 2 presents the latest energy data to set the scene and describes the scenario\\ns used in this year™s analysis, the assumptions that underpin them, and how and why they \\n\\ndiffer from each other.\\n  Chapter\\n 3 focuses on the gap between the announced pledges, made by governments \\nin the run\\n-up to COP26, and the goal to limit the rise of\\n the g\\nlobal average temperature\\n to \\n1.5 \\n°C, and examines in detail how this gap can be closed.\\n  Chapter\\n 4 examines what it will take to implement the announced pledges, and looks \\nbroadly at the projections for energy demand and electricity \\nacross\\n all of our scenar\\nios.\\n  Chapter\\n 5 continues the multi\\n-scenario approach and explores the outlook for various \\nfuels.\\n  Chapter\\n 6 presents a cross\\n-cutting thematic discussion of the various energy security \\nhazards that could arise during energy \\ntransitions\\n, both in domestic ener\\ngy systems and \\ninternationally.\\n The chapter structure for future editions of the \\nOutlook \\nseries remains open, but other new \\n\\nelements in the \\nWEO\\n-2021\\n are set to remain as integral parts of the \\nWEO\\n approach. The main \\nexample is the \\nNet Zero Emissions by 2050\\n Scenario (NZE), first released as part of the \\nlandmark IEA report in May 2021 \\nŒ \\nNet Zero Emissions by 2050: A Roadmap for the Global \\nEnergy Sector\\n. The topic covered by this scenario is not new to the \\nWEO\\n, as analysis of \\npossible pathways to \\n1.5 \\n°C has fe\\natured in all recent \\nOutlooks\\n, but the NZE now joins the \\nstable of core IEA scenarios that will be regulatory updated and featured in the \\nWEO\\n series \\nof analyses and publications.\\n In discussion of fuels, the \\nWEO\\n now makes more regular use of the terms ﬁsoli\\nd, liquid and \\ngaseousﬂ fuels, rather than coal, oil and natural gas. This allows us to take a broader view of \\n\\nthe roles of different types of fuel and the energy services that they provide. For example, \\n\\ngaseous fuels can include not only natural gas, but also biogas, hydrogen and synthetic gas. \\nIn rapid energy transitions, these low\\n-carbon fuels take a progressively larger share of the \\nmarket.\\n In addition, note that the generic energy values in this \\nWEO\\n are expressed in exajoules (EJ), \\nwhereas they were previously expressed in million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe). One EJ is \\nequivalent to 23.88 Mtoe.\\n         Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 25  Chapter \\n1 Overview\\n Key themes of WEO\\n-2021\\n   In the run\\n-up to a crucial COP26 meeting in Glasgow, this \\nWorld Energy Outlook\\n-2021\\n (WEO\\n-2021\\n) provides a detailed picture of how far countries have come in their clean \\nenergy transitions, and how far they still have to go. A new global energy economy is \\nemerging, but will need to take shape much more quickly to avoid severe impacts \\nfrom a changin\\ng climate. \\n  An outlook based on today™s policy settings, the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), \\nshows aggregate fossil fuel demand slowing to a plateau in the 2030s and then falling \\nslightly by 2050, the first time this has been projected in this scenario. \\nAlmost all of \\nthe net growth in energy demand comes from low emissions sources. Nonetheless, \\nthe \\nglobal average temperature\\n rise\\n in this scenario \\npasses \\nthe\\n 1.5 \\ndegrees Celsius \\n(°C) \\nmark \\naround 2030\\n and would still be \\nclimbing \\nas \\nit \\nreach\\nes\\n 2.6 \\n°C \\nin 2100.\\n Figure\\n 1.1 \\n CO\\n2 emissions by sector and scenario \\n IEA.

However, a much greater global \\neffort will be essential to reach the r\\nelative safety of the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 \\nScenario (NZE).

Funds for sustainable recovery are scarce and \\ncapital remains up to seven\\n-times mo\\nre expensive than in advanced economies, at a \\nmoment when their economies are entering what has historically been an energy\\n- \\nand emissions\\n-intensive process of urban expansion and infrastructure development. \\n  An international catalyst will be essential to \\naccelerate clean energy deployment and \\nto allow developing economies \\nŒ \\nwhere per capita emissions are often very low \\nŒ \\nto \\nchart a new lower emissions path for development; as things stand, emissions from \\nemerging market and developing economies (excluding China) increase \\nmore than \\n5 \\nGt to 2050 in the STEPS, with the largest growth from industry and transport.\\n  Transitions are accompanied by marked shifts in energy sector employment, but clean \\nenergy jobs expand faster than other sectors fall. The downside ri\\nsks for jobs are \\nconcentrated in the coal sector, where retirements of coal\\n-fire\\nd capacity approach \\n100 \\ngigawatts (GW) per year over the coming decade in the NZE, almost double the \\nfigure in the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS). Phasing out coal requires a\\nn \\naccelerated scale up of new low emissions generation and infrastructure, as well as a \\nsustained commitment by governments and the international community to manage \\nthe impacts on communities, assets, land and the local environment.\\n  Price volatility is an\\n ever\\n-present \\nfeature of\\n commodity markets, but well\\n-managed \\ntransitions offer ways to dampen the impacts on household energy bills. Compared \\nwith the situation in STEPS, the effect of a large price shock in 2030 in the NZE is \\nreduced by efficiency gains and lower direct consumption of oil and gas.\\n  Getting the world on track for net zero emissions by 2050 requires transition\\n-related \\ninvestment to \\naccelerate\\n from current levels to \\naround\\n USD\\n 4 trillion annually by \\n2030, but only a minority of these investmen\\nts immediately deliver zero emissions \\nenergy or energy services. Ensuring that other investments are financed, for example \\nthose that aid transitions in emissions\\n-intensive sectors, is a key challenge for \\nfinanciers, investors and policy makers.\\n  If the wor\\nld gets on track for net zero emissions by 2050, then the cumulative market \\nopportunity for manufacturers of wind turbines, solar panels, lithium\\n-ion batteries, \\nelectrolysers and fuel cells amounts to USD\\n 27 \\ntrillion. These five elements alone in \\n2050 woul\\nd be larger than today™s oil industry and its associated revenues.\\n  Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 27  1 Introduction\\n In a momentous period for the future of energy and emissions, this \\nWorld Energy Outlook\\n uses several long\\n-term scenarios to illustrate the choices that face the world™s decision \\nmakers in the run\\n-up to the crucial 26\\nth Conference of the Parties (COP26) in November and \\nbeyond. A key variable in determining where the world goes from here is action taken by \\ngovernments. They do not hold all the levers: individuals, communities, civil society, \\n\\ncompanies and investors can all make a major difference. But none have the same capacity \\nas governments to shape the future of energy by setting the framework conditions that \\nchannel investment to energy projects, by supporting innovation, by giving clear signals \\n\\nabout their long\\n-term ambitions and by taking the necessary steps to realise them. \\n This \\nOutlook\\n takes into consideration the full diversity of country circumstances, resources, \\ntechnologies and potential policy choices in its examination of the scenario projections. \\n\\nCountries are not starting this journey from the same place. Many developing economies, in \\nparticular, are facing a continued public he\\nalth crisis and the impacts of the Covid\\n-19 \\npandemic on their economies and energy sectors will be felt for years to come. By contrast, \\nmore rapid progress with mass vaccination campaigns leaves most advanced economies and \\nthe People™s Republic of China (hereafter China) with a clearer near\\n-term pathway to \\nrecovery, though many uncertainties and risks remain.\\n The main scenarios in this \\nOutlook \\nare: \\n  Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario\\n (NZE), which sets out a \\nnarrow\\n but achievable \\npathway for the global ener\\ngy sector to achieve net zero C\\nO2 emissions by 2050. \\n  Announced Pledges Scenario\\n (APS), which\\n assumes that all climate commitments made \\nby governments around the world, including Nationally Determined Contributions \\n(NDCs) and longer term net zero targets, \\nwill be met in full and on time. \\n  Stated Policies Scenario\\n (STEPS), which\\n reflects current policy settings based on a \\nsector\\n-by\\n-sector assessment of the specific policies that are in place, as well as those \\nthat have been announced by governments around the world. \\n There are also references to the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), which, like the \\nNZE, achieves key energy\\n-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related to \\nuniversal energy access and major improvements in air quality, and r\\neaches global net zero \\nemissions by 2070 (with many countries and regions reaching net zero much earlier). The \\n\\nAnnounced \\nPledges \\nand New Zero Emissions by 2050 scenarios are introduced for the first \\ntime this year. Updates have been incorporated into the S\\nTEPS (Box\\n 1.1) and to the SDS since \\nthe \\nWEO\\n-2020\\n. All the scenarios are described in detail in Chapter\\n 2. \\nThis Overview chapter explores ten key themes covering the risks, trade\\n-offs and benefits of \\ndifferent courses of action. The \\nOutlook\\n is based on rigorous modelling and analysis, \\nreflecting the latest energy data, policy announcements, investment trends and technology \\n\\ndevelopments, but it keeps in mind two core tenets: the crucial role of energy in human well\\n-being and social and economic development; and the responsibility of the energy sector for \\nnearly three\\n-quarters of the emissions that are causing climate change. \\n  28 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   Box\\n 1.1 \\n One STEPS beyond– \\nThe Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) is based on prevailing policy settings and so provides \\na useful barometer of the strength and impact of these policies over time. Compared \\nwith the \\nWEO\\n-2020\\n, some of the largest changes in the STEPS in this \\nOutlook\\n are:\\n  \\n Total fossil fuel demand is higher in the near term than in the \\nWEO\\n-2020\\n STEPS. \\nHowever, it is also markedly lower after \\n2030\\n. For the first time, aggregate fossil fuel \\ndemand slows to a plateau in the 2030s and then falls slightly by 2050\\n (\\nFigure\\n 1.2\\n).  Natural gas demand is around 600\\n billion cubic metres (bcm) (or 10%) lower in 2050 \\nthan in the \\nWEO\\n-2020\\n STEPS, mainly reflecting lower proje\\ncted \\nconsumption\\n in the \\npower and industry sectors in emerging market and developing economies in Asia. \\n  Oil demand starts to decline in the 2030s for the first time in the STEPS as a result of \\nmore muted growth in petrochemicals and faster reductions else\\nwhere.\\n  Coal use rebounds more rapidly in the near term and stays above last year™s \\nprojections until around \\n2030\\n, but its subsequent decline is faster than projected in \\n2020 (and much faster than projected five years ago).\\n  Total CO\\n2 emissions are around 2\\n Gt lower in 2050 than in last year™s STEPS\\n. Most of \\nthe difference is in the \\npower sector\\n, where \\nemissions\\n fall by more than 25% \\nbetween 2020 and 2050 (\\ncompared\\n with a decline of less than 10% in the \\nWEO\\n-2020\\n). Generation from solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind in 2050 is around \\n15% and 20% respectively higher in this \\nOutlook\\n. \\nFigure\\n 1.2 \\n Oil, natural gas and coal demand in the Stated Policies \\nScenario in \\nWorld \\nEnergy\\n Outlook\\n 2021, 2020 and \\n2016  IEA.

In 2020, even as economies sank under the weight \\nof Covid\\n-19 lockdowns, \\nadditions of \\nrenewable sources of energy such as wind and solar \\nPV \\nincreased \\nat their fastest rate in two decades, and \\nelect\\nric vehicle sales set new records. A \\nnew energy economy is coming into view, ushered forward by policy action, technology \\n\\ninnovation and the increasing urgency of the need to tackle climate change. There is \\nno \\n\\nguarantee that the emergence of this new energ\\ny economy will be \\nsmooth\\n, and it is not \\ncoming forward quickly enough to avoid severe impacts from a changing climate. But it is \\n\\nalready clear that tomorrow™s energy economy promises to be quite different from the one \\n\\nwe have today.\\n Electricity\\n is taking o\\nn an ever\\n-more central role in the lives of consumers and, for an \\nincreasing number of households, it promises to become the energy source on which they \\n\\nrely for all their everyday needs: mobility, cooking, lighting, heating and cooling. The \\nreliability and affordability of electricity is set to become even more critical to all aspects of \\npeople™s lives and well\\n-being. \\n Electricity™s share of the world™s final consumption of energy has risen steadily over recent \\ndecades, and now stands at 20%. Its rise accelerates in future years as the pace of transitions \\npicks up\\n. In the NZE, electricity accounts for around 50% of final energy use by 2050 (around \\n30% in the APS). Given that electricity delivers useful energy services with better efficiency \\nthan other fuels, the contribution of electricity is even higher than these numbers would \\nsuggest.\\n The rise of electricity requires a parallel increase in its share of energy\\n-related investment. \\nSince 2016, global investment in the power sector has consistently been higher than in oil \\n\\nand gas supply. The faster that clean energy transitions proceed, the\\n wider this gap becomes, \\nand as a result electricity becomes the central arena for energy\\n-related financial transactions. \\nIn the NZE, investment in power generation and infrastructure is six\\n-times higher than in oil \\nand gas supply by 2030. \\n Clean technolog\\nies\\n in the power sector and across a range of end\\n-uses have become the first \\nchoice for consumers around the world, initially due to policy support but over time because \\n\\nthey are simply the most cost\\n-effective. In most regions, solar PV or wind already rep\\nresents \\nthe cheapest available source of new electricity generation. Based on total costs of \\nownership, \\nthe case for electric cars in many markets is already a compelling one\\n. \\nIn the new energy economy, the huge market opportunity for clean technology beco\\nmes a \\nmajor new area for investment and international competition; countries and companies \\n\\njostle for position in global supply chains. We estimate that, if the world gets on track for net \\nzero emissions by 2050, then the annual market opportunity for manufacturers of wind \\n\\nturbines, solar panels, lithium\\n-ion batteries, electrolysers and fuel cells grows tenfold to \\nUSD\\n 1.2 \\ntrillion by 2050, around 3.5\\n-times larger than in the STEPS (Spotlight). These five \\nelements alone would be larger than today™s oil industry and its associated revenues. \\n  30 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n    Sizing the market opportunity \\nfor\\n clean energy\\n  \\nAchieving net zero emissions requires an unparalleled increase in clean energy \\ninvestment. In the NZE, annual investment in clean energy rises to USD\\n 4 \\ntrillio\\nn by 2030, \\nmore than tripling from current levels. Mobilising such a large investment will be \\nchallenging, but the investment required to secure clean energy transitions offers an \\nunprecedented level of market opportunities to equipment manufacturers, serv\\nice \\nproviders, developers and engineering, procurement and construction companies along \\nthe entire clean energy supply chain.\\n In the NZE, the combined size of the market for wind turbines, solar panels, lithium\\n-ion \\nbatteries, electrolysers and fuel cells represents a cumulative market opportunity to 2050 \\nworth USD\\n 27 \\ntrillion. At over 60% of the total, batteries account for the lion™s share of \\nthe estimated market for clean energy technology equipment in 2050 \\n(Figure\\n 1.3\\n). With \\nover 3\\n billion electric vehicles (EVs) on the road and 3\\n terawatt\\n-hours (TWh) of battery \\nstorage deployed in the NZE in 2050, batteries play a central part in the new energy \\neconomy\\n. They also become the single largest source of demand for various critical \\nminerals such as lithium, nickel and cobalt (IEA, 2021a). \\n Figure\\n 1.3 \\n Estimated market size for selected clean energy technologies \\nby technology and \\nregion, 2020-2050 \\n IEA.

In the NZE, the \\nAs\\nia Pacific region is home to 45% of the estimated market for clean energy technologies \\nby 2050, and the share of the market accounted for by North America and Europe is lower \\nthan it was earlier in the period. \\n Many countries are seeking to develop manufacturing expertise and capabilities that \\nwould allow them to use some locally produced products to meet domestic demand, and \\nalso to participate in global supply chains and to license related intellectual property. \\nEnergy start\\n-up companies have an important\\n part to play in this. Despite the pandemic, \\nrecord\\n-breaking levels of capital have flowed to clean energy technology start\\n-ups, with \\ninvestment in 2021 expected to surpass the USD\\n 4 \\nbillion in early\\n-stage equity raised in \\n2019, which was the previous peak\\n year. The United States still accounts for around half \\nof the capital being invested, but Europe was the only major region to increase \\ninvestment in 2020 and China™s share of the market has risen from 5% in\\n the\\n 2010-14 \\nperiod\\n to over 35% in the last three\\n years. \\n Governments everywhere are also actively seeking to attract additional talent. India and \\nSingapore have launched government initiatives to support international clean energy \\nentrepreneurs. China, Japan and United States have recently made high\\n-level \\ncommitments to energy R&D and innovation, framing it as a critical area of technological \\ncompetition in coming years. In Europe, public initiatives like the European Battery \\nAlliance are actively seeking to create new value chains. There is a momentous \\nopportunity for the best innovators to capture a share of emerging value chains that have \\nhuge future potential.\\n The new energy economy involves varied and often complex interactions between \\nelectricity, fuels and storage markets, creating fresh challenges for regulation and market \\ndesign. A major question is how to manage the potential for \\nincreased variability\\n on b\\noth \\nthe demand and supply sides of the energy equation. The variability of electricity supply will \\nbe affected by rising shares of wind and solar PV, putting a huge premium on robust grids \\nand other sources of supply flexibility. The variability of demand will be shaped by increasing \\n\\ndeployment of heat pumps and air conditioners (the latter especially in developing \\neconomies, where current ownership levels are low), and could be exacerbated by poorly \\nsequenced recharging of EV fleets or by cold snaps, heat \\nwaves or other extreme weather \\n\\nevents. Without effective policies to prepare for and manage these fluctuations, the daily \\nvariation of demand could increase on\\n the basis of announced pledges\\n to 270\\n gigawatts (GW) \\nin the European Union (from 120\\n GW today) a\\nnd over 170\\n GW in India (from 40\\n GW) by mid\\n-century. \\n Digital technologies play crucial roles in integrating different aspects of the new energy \\nsystem. Sectors that have hitherto operated largely independently (such as electricity and \\n\\ntransport) become connected in new ways with the rise of electric mobility, and grids need \\n 32 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   to cope with a much greater diversity and complexity of flows as many new players, including \\nhouseholds, enter the arena as producers. Managing the platforms and data required to keep \\nthis system operating effectively becomes a central part of the new energy economy, as does \\nmitigating associated cybersecurity and data privacy risks.\\n Clean electrification is the dominant theme in the early phases of the transformation of the \\n\\nglobal energ\\ny economy together with\\n the quest for improvements in efficiency. Over time, \\nhowever, continued rapid deployment in these areas needs to be accompanied by \\nclean \\nenergy innovation\\n and the widespread use of technologies that are not yet readily available \\non \\nthe market. These technologies are vital to decarbonise areas such as heavy industry and \\nlong\\n-distance transport that are not readily susceptible to electrification for one reason or \\nanother, and they include advanced batteries, hydrogen electrolysers, advanced biofuels, \\nand new technologies for the capture and use of CO\\n2, including direct air capture. Building \\nthese additional pillars of the new energy economy requires early and sustained investment \\nin energy R&D and an accelerated programme of demonstrati\\non projects.\\n These changes redirect global \\nflows of trade and capital\\n. The combined share of hydrogen \\nand critical minerals (such as lithium, cobalt, copper and rare earths elements) in global \\n\\nenergy\\n-related trade rises to one\\n-quarter of the total in the APS, and takes a dominant share \\nin the NZE as the value of fossil fuels trade declines significantly (\\nsee section\\n 1.9\\n). This \\ncompletely upends the present dynamics of international energy\\n-related trade, and it is \\naccompanied by a major shift in energy\\n-relat\\ned financial flows: the decline in the value of \\ntrade in fossil fuels causes the dollar\\n-denominated revenues accruing to\\n producer economies \\nfrom oil and gas exports to decline significantly over time. \\n The new energy economy depicted in the NZE is a collaborative one in which countries \\ndemonstrate a shared focus on securing the necessary reductions in emissions, while \\n\\nminimising and taking precautions against new energy security risks. However, the APS \\nhighlights the \\npossibility\\n of new divisions\\n and fragmentation\\n as \\ncountries proceed at \\ndifferent speeds through energy transitions. By the 2030s, for example, the APS sees the \\nproduction of ﬁgreenﬂ steel in economies that have pledged to reach net zero alongside the \\ncontinuing use of traditional emission\\ns-\\nintensive methods elsewhere, deepening tensions \\naround trade in energy\\n-intensive goods. There could be a gulf too in international investment \\nand finance: increasingly stringent disciplines applicable to financial flows may mean that \\n\\ncapital from the ﬁnet zeroﬂ world does not flow very freely to countries undergoing slower \\ntransitions. Successful, orderly and broad\\n-based transitions in which countries enjoy the \\nbenefits of global trade will depend on finding ways to lessen and manage the potential \\ntension\\ns in the international system that are highlighted in the APS.\\n 1.2\\n Scenario trajectories and temperature outcomes\\n This \\nWorld Energy Outlook\\n provides a detailed stocktake of how far nations have come in \\ntheir energy transitions, and a sobering picture of how far there still is to go.

Boosting clean energy innovation is essential to bring new technologies through \\nthe \\ndemonstration and prototype stages so that they are ready to scale \\nup\\n dramatically in \\nthe 2030s\\n in areas where electrification is difficult to achieve, such as heavy industry and \\nlong\\n-distance transport. Ensuring adequate financing for all of these priority areas is a crucial \\ncross\\n-cutting component. \\n There are strong synergies between all of these efforts\\n. Clean electrification brings major \\nefficiency gains, as well as helping to decarbonise end\\n-use\\n sectors, because many electric \\ntechnologies are significantly more efficient th\\nan their fossil\\n fuel counterparts. For example, \\ntoday™s electric cars use on average 70% less energy to travel one kilometre than a \\n\\nconventional ca\\nr. \\nIn turn, by \\nreducing upward pressure on electricity demand, efficiency \\nmeasures on appliances and equipment make it easier for cleaner sources of power to gain \\nmarket share. Clean electrification and efficiency bring down fossil fuel demand and \\nproduction. This helps to reduce associated methane emissions, although it is not a \\n\\nsubstitute for concerted policy efforts to reduce emissions as quickly as possible from fossil \\nfuel operations. Innovation has the potential to support more rapid electrification, for \\nexample through the development of advanced batteries that are able to bring electricity \\n\\ninto heavy\\n-duty segments of the transport sector, and also to bring low emissions electricity \\nindirectly into other sectors via low\\n-carbon hydrogen. \\n Clean electrification\\n Cleaning up the elec\\ntricity mix and extending the electrification of end\\n-uses is a central pillar \\nof transition strategies. It plays a key role in the structural transformation of the energy \\n\\nsector in all our scenarios, and it supports energy\\n-related sustainable development g\\noals, \\nnotably access to electricity. \\n The electricity sector emitted 12.3\\n Gt CO\\n2 in 2020 (36% of all energy\\n-related emissions), \\nwhich is more than any other sector. Coal remains the largest single source of electricity \\n\\nworldwide, and by far the largest source of electricity sector emissions: it contributes just \\nover one\\n-third of electricity supply but is responsible for nearly three\\n-quarters of electricity \\nsector CO\\n2 emissions. The power sector is already moving away from coal, and it continues \\nto do so in \\nall our scenarios. A\\nccelerating the decarbonisation of the electricity \\nmix\\n is the \\nsingle most important \\nway \\nto close the 2030 gap between the APS and NZE\\n. In the NZE, faster \\ndecarbonisation of electricity cuts emissions by 5\\n Gt, compared with the APS, and \\nthis \\naccounts for 40% of the CO\\n2 emissions gap between the two scenarios in 2030. We calculate \\nthat nearly 60% of this total (about 2.9\\n Gt) could be cut at no cost to electricity consumers. \\n Rapid decarbonisation of the electricity sector requires a massive surge in the deployment \\nof low emissions generation. The share of renewables increases from almost 30% of \\nelectricity generation globally in 2020 to about 45% in 2030 in the APS, but this is still fifteen \\npercentage points short of the level reached in the NZE. Nuclear power and dispatchable low \\n\\nemissions capacity, such as hydropower, biomass and geothermal are important elements of \\n 40 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   the picture, but capacity additions are dominated by solar PV and wind. The largest increases \\nin deployment to close the emissions gap take place in emerging market and developing \\neconomies.\\n Decarbonising the global power sector is not only a question of expanding low emissions \\ngeneration, but also of tackling emissions from existing sources. This requires an end to \\ninvestment \\nin new unabated coal\\n-fired power plants, as well as strategies to retrofit, \\nrepurpose or retire existing ones (\\nsee section\\n 1.7\\n). Scaling up grids and all sources of \\nflexibility, including energy storage systems, is also\\n pivotal: investment in electricity \\ninfrastructure in the NZE accelerates more quickly than investment in generation. Alongside \\na rapid expansion and modernisation of grids, utility\\n-scale battery storage capacity increases \\n18-\\ntimes from 2020 to 2030 in the APS, and more than 30\\n-times in the N\\nZE.  \\nThe transformation of electricity supply goes hand\\n-in\\n-hand with a major increase in \\nelectricity use as demand in existing end\\n-uses grows and as new end\\n-uses such as transport \\nand heating are electrified (\\nFigure\\n 1.8\\n). Rapid electrification of passenger mobility in \\nadvanced economies and China is already built into the APS, and expanding this to emerging \\n\\nmarket and developing economies is essential if \\nthe gap between the APS and the NZE is to \\nbe closed.

Without this improvement in energy efficiency, \\ntotal final consumption in the NZE would be about a third higher in 2030, significantly \\n\\nincreasing the cost and difficulty of decarbonising energy supply.\\n Much stronger policies on end\\n-use energy\\n efficiency in the NZE reduce emissions by about \\n1.3 \\nGt CO\\n2 in 2030, compared with the APS, and are of particular importance in the transport \\nand buildings sectors. We estimate that \\nalmost 8\\n0% of these additional energy efficiency \\ngains in the NZE could be\\n achieved cost\\n-effectively over the next decade. Avoided demand \\nthrough measures such as digitalisation and \\nmaterial\\ns efficiency reduce emissions in the NZE \\nby a further 1\\n.3 Gt by 2030: much of the potential here is in the industry sector, where \\nopportunit\\nies \\nfor material\\ns efficiency are substantial and low emissions technologies are less \\nmature than in most other sectors. Behavioural changes contribute around another 1\\n Gt by \\n2030 to the additional emissions reductions in the NZE, notably in the transport s\\nector. \\n Stronger standards for appliances and fuel economy are instrumental in achieving these \\n\\nefficiency gains in the NZE, as is a stronger policy emphasis on materials e\\nfficiency in industry. \\nIn the buildings sector, the number of building retrofits would need to increase two\\n-and\\n-half\\n-times compared with announced pledges to close the gap; this is particularly important \\nin advanced economies.

If countries were to implement a \\n\\nset of well\\n-established policy tools \\nŒ \\nnamely leak detection and repair requirements, staple \\ntechnology standards and a ban on non\\n-emergency flaring and venting \\nŒ \\nemissions from oil \\nand gas operations could be halved within a short timeframe (\\nIEA,\\n 2021b\\n). Further reductions \\ncould be pursued through measures such as performance standards or emissio\\nn taxes \\nsupported by more robust measurement and verification systems. Technology \\n\\ndevelopments, in particular in the field of satellite observation, could help with the \\n\\ndevelopment of such systems. Applying a USD\\n 15\\n/t CO\\n2-eq price to methane from oil and g\\nas \\noperations would be enough to deploy nearly all abatement measures.\\n There are also \\nopportunities to \\nreduce\\n methane emissions\\n from coal production\\n using\\n existing technolog\\nies. However a\\nbatement opportunities in the\\n coal\\n sector \\nare often less \\ncost\\n-effecti\\nve \\nthan in the oil and gas sector.

Around one\\n-third of this decline is the result of an overall \\nreduction in fossil fuel consumption. The larger share comes from a rapid deployment of \\nemissions reduction measures and technologies, which leads to the elimination of all \\ntech\\nnically avoidable methane emissions by 2030.\\n Innovation\\n Clean electrification, efficiency and methane emissions reductions do the heavy lifting over \\n\\nthe next ten years, but they cannot carry the world all the way to a net zero future. Almost \\nhalf of the emissions reductions achieved in the NZE in 2050 come from\\n technologies that \\nare at the demonstration or prototype stage today, and that are needed in particular to \\ndecarbonise heavy industrial sectors and long\\n-distance transport because these sectors are \\nin general not susceptible to electrification. For this reason, another important ﬁ\\ngapﬂ that \\nneeds to be closed in the 2020s relates to innovation. Governments need to step up support \\n\\nin key technology areas, such as advanced batteries, low\\n-carbon fuels, hydrogen \\nelectrolysers and direct air capture. They also need to collaborate internationally to reduce \\ncosts and ease the path of new technologies to market. In the NZE, around USD\\n 90 \\nbillion of \\npublic money is mobilised to complete a portfolio of demonstration projects before 2030. \\n\\nCurrently, only about USD\\n 25 \\nbi\\nllion is budgeted for that period. \\n Announced pledges lag on key NZE milestones related to hydrogen\\n-based and other low\\n-carbon fuels, as well as CCUS. For example, by 2030 the APS achieves less than 40% of the \\n\\nlevel of deployment of clean shipping fuels seen in the NZE, and it is even further behind the \\n\\nNZE on the deployment of hydrogen in industry. Options like industrial CCUS or electric trucks \\nmake substantial inroads into emissions in the NZE only after 2030, but early deployment \\nbefore 2030 is essentia\\nl to drive down costs and establish enabling infrastructure. Because \\nof long infrastructure lifetimes and relatively slow rates of change in these areas, catching up \\nafter 2030 will be particularly challenging if these milestones are missed. It is therefor\\ne \\ncritical that policy support in the near term is directed towards early deployment of key \\ninnovative technologies and the development of supporting infrastructure. \\n In the NZE, new technologies that have an important future role make vital early progress\\n. Hydrogen\\n-based fuels and fossil fuels with CCUS make up just under 1.5% of total final \\nconsumption by 2030, up from almost nothing today. These relatively small inroads into the \\nmarket prepare the ground for these technologies to ramp up after 2030 and m\\nake a bigger \\ncontribution towards net zero energy emissions by 2050. \\n 1.4\\n Energy consumers of \\ntomorrow\\n Any assessment of the outlook for global energy and emissions has to assign a central place \\nto emerging market and developing economies. There are billions of people on the planet \\n\\nwho do not yet have the housing stock and appliances that are taken for granted across most \\nadvanced economies, and hundreds of millions of people who lack even the most basic \\n 44 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   access to modern energy. Emerging market and developing e\\nconomies excluding China\\n7 account for two\\n-thirds of the global population today, and they will be home to the vast \\nmajority of the two billion people that look set to be added to the world™s population by \\n2050. The population of sub\\n-Saharan Africa is projected to grow especially fast, and is on \\ncourse to double by 2050. \\n As China has amply demonstrated over the last two decades, and many advanced economies \\nbefore it, the process of constructing the infrastructure needed in a modern and rapidly \\n\\ndeveloping economy up till now has bee\\nn very energy\\n- \\nand emissions\\n-intensive. With many \\nemerging market and developing countries now considering how best to meet their future \\n\\nenergy and development needs, t\\nhe falling costs of key clean energy technologies offer a \\nmajor opportunity to chart a new, lower emissions path to growth that is centred on clean \\n\\nelectrification and efficiency (\\nsee section\\n 1.3\\n). However, no country has yet shown a cost\\n-effective way to \\nleapfrog \\nto low\\n-carbon technologies in all areas of energy use, such as steel, \\ncement an\\nd freight that are instrumental to the construction and operation of modern \\neconomies.\\n The starting point for this journey is not a propitious one. Most emerging market and \\n\\ndeveloping economies face an ongoing public health crisis with the Covid\\n-19 pandemi\\nc, \\nwithout the means or the opportunity to start mass vaccination campaigns in earnest. The \\n\\npandemic has been a setback for efforts to improve access to modern energy and has further \\n\\nstrained the finances of the utilities that are key investors in grids an\\nd off\\n-takers for \\nrenewable projects (Box\\n 1.2). Increased borrowing to cope with the effects of the pandemic \\nhas left little room for many governments to kick\\n-start investment in sustainable recoveries; \\nthe annual boost to clean energy coming from public recovery spending amounts to less than \\n\\nUSD\\n 10 \\nbillion by 2023. \\nOverall, if China is excluded, emerging market and developing \\neconomies account for one\\n-fifth of the amounts being invested worldwide on clean energy.\\n Across all fuels and technologies, emerging \\nmarket and developing economies are \\n\\ninstrumental in shaping global trends in the coming decades. In the STEPS, oil demand in \\n\\nthese economies is 12\\n million barrels per day (mb/d) higher in 20\\n30 than in 20\\n20 (an increase \\nof nearly 30%), gas demand by 520\\n bcm\\n (a near\\n-25% increase), and coal demand by \\n160 \\nmillion tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) (a 4% rise). Demand for fossil fuels in advanced \\neconomies falls in the APS, but announced pledges do not bend projected demand trends \\n\\nacross much of the developing wor\\nld. \\n Nevertheless, there are some indications of structural change. The energy intensity of GDP \\n\\nimproves by \\n2.8\\n% annually in the STEPS\\n in this decade\\n; it is\\n accompanied by a similarly \\npositive outlook for carbon intensity. Progress with \\nenergy efficien\\ncy a\\nnd clean electrification \\nhelps to underpin these trends. More stringent energy performance standards for air \\n\\nconditioners in India are a case in point, helping to improve the efficient use of energy in a \\n\\nfast\\n-growing segment that could otherwise push up peak demand and exacerbate strains on \\nthe power sector. \\n                                                                                                                          7 China is included in the aggregate numbers for the category \\nemerging market and developing economies\\n in \\nthis \\nOutlook\\n. However, the scale of \\nthe\\n country™s industrialisation and infrastructure development over the \\npast two decades means that it dominates thi\\ns aggregate, so China is often considered in a category of its \\nown\\n. \\n Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 45  1 Box\\n 1.2 \\n Momentum has been lost on access: It needs to be regained fast \\nToday, \\n770 million pe\\nople \\nworldwide\\n still live \\nwithout access to electricity\\n, mostly in \\nAfrica and developing countries in Asia.

Between 2019 and 2021, \\nhowever, it increased by 30\\n million (slightl\\ny over 1%). The pandemic diminished the \\nability of many to pay for modern fuels and to travel to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) \\nrefilling stations during lockdowns, and more time spent at home increased exposure to \\nair pollution and the associated health ri\\nsks. Governments and develop\\nment a\\ngencies have \\nprovided emergency financial relief\\n to \\nreduce the\\nse impact\\ns.

Many of these support schemes \\nwil\\nl \\nneed to be extended to \\noffset\\n the continuing impact of Covid\\n-19, and to provide renewed momentum towards \\naccess to modern energy for all as economic recoveries accelerate. \\n China is currently a global leader in renewable energy installations, and this continues in our \\nscenarios, but an increasing number of emerging market and developing economies are \\nfollowing suit. The pace of capacity additions picks up in many countries in\\n the STEPS: these \\ninclude well\\n-established markets like India and Brazil, where transport biofuels also flourish, \\nas well as more recent ones in the Middle East and Africa.

This reflects increased uptake o\\nf industrial electric motors and rising levels of \\nappliance ownership rather than large\\n-scale electrification of new end\\n-uses such as \\ntransport. While electric two/three\\n-wheelers gain ground quickly in many countries, \\npassenger EVs face a number of non\\n-eco\\nnomic barriers that are not completely overcome in \\nthe STEPS (or in the APS). These include insufficient recharging infrastructure, weak or \\n\\nunreliable grids, and reliance in some countries, especially in Africa, on the second\\n-hand \\nvehicle market where EVs \\nwill only become available with a time lag. Despite these barriers, \\nthere are\\n some economies within this grouping (for example Singapore and Costa Rica) that \\nalready have phase\\n-out policies in place for different categories of conventional vehicles. \\n Clean\\n electrification cannot \\nanswer\\n all the \\nneeds of\\n economi\\nes undergoing rapid \\nurbanisation and industrialisation.

But the idea \\nthat all energy sector investments divide neatly into ﬁcleanﬂ and ﬁdirtyﬂ does not survive \\ncontact with the realities of energy transitions. Our scenarios reveal a large number of \\ngradations: a large portion of investments go towards sectors, technologies and \\ninfrastructure that do not immediately deliver zero emissions energy or energy services, \\nbut do enable such investments or provide incremental\\n emissions reductions; some of \\nthese investments can also \\nhelp to deliver zero emissions energy over time, but are \\ncontingent on actions elsewhere in the system, notably those concerned with \\ndecarbonising the power sector. In practice, this middle ground o\\nf actions that ﬁmake \\ndirty cleanerﬂ is crucial in determining the speed and scope of energy transitions, and \\ndelivers the largest share of emissions reductions in getting from the STEPS trajectory to \\na net zero one (\\nFig\\nure\\n 1.13\\n).

Examples include efficiency or \\nflexibility measures that reduce f\\nossil fuel use, investments that support fuel \\nswitching away from coal or oil to less polluting alternatives (e.g. new gas boilers \\nthat replace coal\\n-fired ones, refurbishments of power plants to support co\\n-firing \\nwith low emissions fuels), and gas\\n-fired plants that enable higher penetration of \\nvariable renewables.\\n  Unabated fossil fuels that do not enable emissions reductions:\\n Investments in coal, \\noil and natural gas that do not provide any emissions reductions from today.\\n10 Examples include investment in coa\\nl mines and in \\nunabated\\n coal\\n-fired power plants.\\n The allocation of investment in certain assets or technologies varies across \\ncountries/regions and over time: for example, a new gas\\n-fired power plant may help to \\nreduce emissions in one area, but not in another; investment in a coal\\n-fired power plant \\nmay shift from one category to another if it is repurposed or retrofitted with CCUS or to \\nco-fire with low\\n-carbon fuels; and investments in electricity grids, appliance efficiency \\nand EVs shift from being contin\\ngent to low emissions as power systems move towards \\nnear full decarbonisation. The results show that in \\nthe NZE\\n around half of investment \\nover the next decade falls in the complex middle ground of spending (\\nFigure\\n 1.14\\n).  The results highlight challenges for environmental,\\n social and\\n governance (ESG) \\nregulation and sustainable finance taxonomies, as well as for companies in their \\ncorporate planning and dec\\nision making. The key challenge is how to ensure that \\nadequate financial channels remain open to support these ﬁcontingentﬂ and ﬁtransitionﬂ \\ninvestments without this becoming a loophole for investments that are not aligned with \\nthe Paris Agreement, or that\\n allow for greenwashing.\\n One of the most important ways for companies to send appropriate signals about \\ninvestment in these categories is by setting credible (science\\n-based) targets that include \\nmeasures to reduce emissions, and to complement this by impro\\nving the quality and \\nquantity of metrics, governance and key performance indicators that allow the financial \\ncommunity to assess their progress towards these targets. A number of companies \\naround the world have set ambitious targets, but their potential im\\npact remains uneven. \\n                                                                                                                         10 Upstream fossil fuel investments are allocated according to how much of the energy produced is used within \\nea\\nch category. For example, investment in a natural gas field is apportioned based on how much of the gas \\nproduced is used with CCUS (assigned to low emissions), used for coal\\n-to-gas switching (assigned to transition), \\nand used without providing any emissions reductions (assigned to unabated fossil fuels).\\n In considering \\ninvestment in fossil fuels, we \\nassume\\n that emissions from the production and processing of fossil fuels is \\nminimised (as is the case in the NZE).\\n  Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 53  1 The S\\ncope\\n 1 and \\nScope\\n 2 emissions reduction targets for the largest oil and gas\\n, and \\nindustrial end\\n-use companies account\\n for less than 5% of the required emissions \\nreductions in those sectors \\nin \\nthe NZE by 2030\\n. \\nIt will also be import\\nant for the financial community to engage with emissions\\n-intensive \\ncompanies and countries to develop credible transition pathways and properly account \\nfor these contingent and transition investments in sustainable finance taxonomies.

Other countries, including \\nSouth\\n Africa, have instituted broad social dialogues on people\\n-centred transitions, \\nencompassing companies, trade unions, regional and local governments, civil society and the \\nfinancial sector.\\n As transitions gain pace, there will be increased competition for clean energy supply chains \\n\\nand related jobs. Most clean energy jobs are created close to the location of a project, \\n\\nwhether it is a wind farm or construction of energy\\n-efficient housing. However, we estimate \\nthat a quarter of energy employment is tied to supply chains that may be located in other \\n\\ncountries, particularly in the case of solar PV, wind, batteries, grid components and vehicle \\n\\ncomponents. Some governments are looking to onshore these elements, or using economic \\nrecovery funding to make strategic investments in emerging segments such as CCUS, \\nadvanced battery technologies and low\\n-carbon fuels. T\\nhese\\n industries\\n, although nascent \\ntoday, grow to employ nearly 1\\n million workers worldwide by 2030 in the APS. Favouring \\ndomestic manufacturing capacity could lead to more secure supply chains in some instances, \\n\\nas well as additional jobs. But, it could also d\\nrive up clean energy technology costs if it erects \\nbarriers to trade and reduces economies of scale.\\n Changes in the energy sector must support \\nsocial and economic development\\n and improve \\nquality of life. A starting point is to bring modern energy to those \\nthat lack access. We \\n\\nestimate that providing universal access to electricity and clean cooking by 2030 would \\nrequire investments of USD\\n 43 \\nbillion per year, closing an important gap in the global energy \\nsystem at a fraction of the overall cost of transitio\\nns. The affordability and security of energy \\nsupply are also vital considerations when it comes to quality of life\\n. \\nThe co\\n-benefits of well\\n-managed transitions include health and productivity\\n gains\\n. Over 90% \\nof the world™s population breathe polluted air o\\nn a daily basis, which we estimate leads to \\nover 5\\n million premature deaths a year. Air pollution also leads to multiple serious diseases, \\nplacing an extra burden on healthcare systems currently struggling to deal with the Covid\\n-19 \\npandemic. While the STEP\\nS \\nand the APS see a rising number of premature deaths during the \\nnext decade, the NZE leads to dramatic reductions: by 2030 there are 1.9\\n million fewer \\npremature deaths from household air pollution per year than in 2020, with over 95% of the \\nreduction occurring in emerging market and developing economies.\\n The average person spends the vast majority of their time indoors, which means that the \\nway transition policies affect buildings is an important element of well\\n-being. In the NZE, \\nimmediate action is taken\\n to ensure that, by the end of this deca\\nde, all new buildings meet \\nzero\\n-carbon\\n-ready standards and around one\\n-in\\n-five existing buildings are retrofitted to \\nthose standards. Shifting to zero\\n-carbon\\n-ready buildings improves thermal comfort through \\nmajor upgrades to building envelopes, e.g. improved insulation, glazing, weatherproofing \\nand optimised ventilation. Remaining heating and cooling needs are met by the most \\nefficient equipment such as heat pumps, often facilitated by automated controls. Managed \\nwell,\\n these improvements can foster good physical and mental health by creating indoor \\nliving environments with healthy air temperatures, humidity levels, noise levels and \\nimproved air quality\\n (IEA, 2017)\\n. Energy efficiency retrofit programmes for low\\n-income \\n 56 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   housing deliver the greatest benefits, while highly energy\\n-efficient workplaces and schools\\n have also demonstrated positive impacts on productivity. \\n Good policy design\\n takes into account issues of \\nequity and inclusion\\n as well\\n. There are many \\nways to \\naddress these issues. For example, action can take the form of recycling\\n revenues \\nfrom carbon pricing schemes to relieve distributional impacts; introducing initiatives to bring \\nyoung generations into the energy and climate policy debate as they have an es\\nsential stake \\nin the consequences of the course that is set; and finding better ways to assess the gender \\nimpacts of policy choices and to advance the participation of women in the energy sector.\\n Far\\n-reaching energy transitions require \\nsupport and engageme\\nnt across society. \\nA number \\nof changes depend on broad social acceptance. In the NZE, at least half of emissions \\n\\nreductions over the next decade require some kind of consumer buy\\n-in, e.g. a decision to \\nswitch to an EV or a heat pump. Around 4% of emissions\\n reductions require behavioural \\nchanges, e.g. cycling rather than driving to work. \\n Box\\n 1.4 \\n Incorporating gender in energy transition policies \\nDespite compelling evidence of the social and economic benefits of equal opportunities \\nand diversity in the labour force, many\\n sectors of the \\nglobal economy perform poorly\\n in \\nterms of gender balance; the energy sector is one of the \\nworst\\n. Women represent a\\n small \\nportion of the labour force and few are in senior positions. At a global level, w\\nomen \\noccupy only one\\n-in\\n-five jobs in the oil and gas sector and one\\n-in\\n-three jobs in the \\nrenewable energy sector (\\nIRENA, 2019\\n). In addition, according to\\n data from almo\\nst \\n2 500 \\npublicly listed energy firms\\n, w\\nomen\\n make up just under 14% of senior managers \\n(representation \\nis \\nstrongest in utilities),\\n compared with 16\\n% in 30\\n 000 \\nnon\\n-energy firms \\n(IEA, 2021c)\\n.  \\nTransitions \\npresent an opportunity\\n to mainstream policies and measures to address \\nissues of gender equality in energy and related sectors\\n. This will require tailored policy \\nsupport, with solutions designed to take into account the specific dynamics of the various \\nsectors and sub\\n-sectors, a\\nnd the channels through which gender equality can be \\nimproved as energy transitions progress. \\n The transport sector provides a good example of the opportunities. At present, there are \\nlarge differences between the ways in which men and women use transport \\nservices\\n. \\nResearch shows \\nthat \\nmobility patterns \\nof women are \\nmuch more \\nfor\\n care work and \\nhousekeeping\\n than is the case for men.\\n The average distance\\ns \\ntravelled \\nalso differ \\nas \\ndo \\nthe number of trips \\nand the time of day.\\n In many countries, w\\nomen have less ac\\ncess to \\nprivate cars than men\\n, \\nand \\nso \\nrepresent a majority \\nof\\n public transport users (\\nITF, 2019\\n). \\nThe exposure \\nof women \\nto different forms of gender\\n-based violence, \\nsuch as\\n harassment \\non public transport, adds an additional layer of risk. \\nWomen\\n sometimes \\nhave to \\ntake \\nlonger trips to ensure safety, especially \\nat night\\n, adding \\nmonthly \\ncosts that can amount \\nto \\nUSD\\n 25-\\n50 (\\nKaufman\\n et al., 2018\\n). Plans to get \\nmore women engaged in the transport \\nsector \\nneed to be designed with these differences in mind.\\n  Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 57  1 Positive e\\nxamples include the \\nCity of Guadalajara in Mexico, which \\nemployed the results \\nfrom \\na comprehensive survey \\non \\nthe \\ntransport \\npatterns of women and girls over a large \\ncorridor and incorporate\\nd its\\n findings into \\ntheir \\npolicy planning (contrary to the \\ntraditional approach based \\non gender\\n-blind origin\\n-destination surveys).\\n M\\nany \\ngovernments have also incorporated gender\\n-related \\napproaches \\nin their government \\nprogrammes or public procurement processes. These include demandi\\nng a minimum \\nshare of women in manufacturing or installation processes, or incorporating a gender \\nassessment \\nwhen evaluating bids.\\n Effective policies across the energy sector\\n require a \\nmuch greater push to support the collection of disaggregated gender dat\\na, which is still \\nrelatively rare. \\n Societal support is about more than consumer buy\\n-in and behaviour\\nal change, important \\nthough they are, and gaining broad public support for change involves some difficult trade\\n-offs. For example, creating economic incen\\ntives for a\\n shift towards heat pumps could make \\nnatural gas more expensive (and push up household heating bills in the interim). Similarly, \\nintroducing carbon prices to generate changes in energy consumption patterns could \\nprovoke a backlash from lower income and/or rural households, in the absence of effective \\n\\nways to manage the distributional consequences. Acceptance of a changing energy sector is \\nalso critical for the siting and permitting of new infrastructure.\\n Energy transitions do not \\nmean an end to l\\narge \\ninfrastructure\\n projects, successful transitions need them. Such projects \\ndo not only include technologies such as CCUS or nuclear, but also wind, solar and grid \\n\\ninvestments, all which can face opposition from local communities. Ways need to be found \\nto engage those concerned and assuage their concerns. A clear and engaged social debate \\non the case for change is vital.\\n 1.7\\n Phasing out coal\\n All scenarios that meet climate goals feature a rapid decline in coal use. It is the most carbon\\n-intensive fuel, predominantly used in a sector \\nŒ \\nelectricity generation \\nŒ \\nwhere renewable \\nenergy options are the most cost\\n-effective new sources in most markets.\\n Global unabated \\ncoal use \\nin the energy system\\n falls by \\naround\\n 5% to 2030 in the STEPS, \\nby\\n 10% in the APS, \\nand\\n by\\n 55% \\nin the NZE.\\n However, managing the move away from coal is not simple, especially \\nwhen it proceeds at the speed required in the NZE where all unabated coal power generation \\n\\nstops by 2040. \\n There are two aspects to the phase\\n-out of coal in the power sector: halting the construction \\nof new plants and managing the decline in emissions from existing assets. The first is the \\n\\neasier to achieve. There are no new investment decisions for the construction of coal\\n-fired \\npower in the NZE, but as much as 200\\n GW receive \\nthe go\\n-ahead and are completed by 2030 \\nin the APS, mainly in China, India and \\nSoutheast Asia,\\n and over \\n215 \\nGW are approved and \\nbuilt by 2030 in the STEPS, and more go ahead after 2030 in both scenarios.\\n There is a \\npowerful economic and environmental case f\\nor countries to proceed instead with low \\n 58 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   emissions sources of electricity, as well as pressure to do so from financial markets and major \\ninternational players: all G7\\n countries have committed to ending new support for unabated \\ncoal\\n-fired power and China has pledged to end support for building new coal plants abroad. \\nChina™s announcement is potentially very significant: it could lead to the cancellation of up \\n\\nto 1\\n90 \\nGW of coal projects that are built in the APS\\n to 2050\\n, saving \\nabout\\n 20 \\nGt in cumulative \\nemiss\\nions if they are replaced with low\\n-emissions generation.\\n We estimate that an even larger amount of 350 GW of coal\\n-fired capacity would not be \\nneeded in 2030 if policy makers establish the enabling conditions \\nand \\nall of the cost\\n-effective \\ndeployment of low \\nemissions sources of electricity is realised (see Chapter 3). This would \\neffectively halt all new investment decisions in the APS and facilitate the retirement of an \\nextra 150\\n GW of coal\\n-fired capacity by 2030. \\n Delivering emissions reductions from the exi\\nsting fleet of coal\\n-fired plants is an even more \\ncrucial component of climate action, but a much trickier challenge for public policy. Given \\n\\nthe dependence of a number of countries and regions on coal, the closure or repurposing of \\ncoal mines and power plants could have significant economic and social consequences. Coal\\n-dependent regions are often highly specialised ﬁmono\\n-industryﬂ areas, where the economy \\nand the local identity are closely tied to the coal value chain. Managing closures \\n\\nappropriately and successfully depends on planning for the impacts on affected workers and \\n\\ncommunities, and on the repurposing and reclamation of affected land. This is likely to entail \\nlong\\n-term engagement by many different parts of government, as well as local businesses.\\n Figure\\n 1.\\n16\\n  Annual average coal power plant retirements in the  \\nAnnounced Pledges and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenarios \\n   IEA.

In total, 2030 emissions from existing coal\\n-fired power \\nplants are three\\n-quarters below the level in 2020, a reduction of over 7 Gt. Existing plants \\nare either retrofitted with CCUS or co\\n-fired with low emissions fuels such as b\\niomass or \\nammonia; repurposed to focus on system adequacy or flexibility; or retired. The retrofit and \\nrepurpose options limit the impact on workers and local communities, but there is \\n\\nnonetheless \\na steep increase in plant retirements. Since 2010, coal power plant retirements \\nhave averaged around 25\\n GW each year, largely reflecting the closure of ageing plants in \\nEurope and the United States (\\nFigure\\n 1.16\\n). In the APS, annual \\nclosures\\n more than double by \\n2030. Meeting the goals of the NZE requires annual retirements averaging over 90\\n GW over \\nthe next decade, removing around 40% of the existing coal power fleet by 2030.\\n12  \\nFigure\\n 1.\\n17\\n   Average age of existing \\ncoal\\n power plants in 2020 in selected \\nregions and average age at retirement in the Net Zero Scenario\\n  IEA.

In \\nadvanced economies, the average age of coal power plant fleet is already almost 35\\n years, \\nand they are retired on average in eight\\n years in the APS and in five\\n years in the NZE.\\n Approaches to phase out coal around the world\\n Phasing out coal at the scale and speed needed in the NZE will require a comprehensive and \\nsustained commitment by national and local governments and the international community \\n\\nto manage transitions for people, communities, assets, land and local environmental quality.\\n Governments have an opportunity to initiate phase outs as part of a broad, coherent and \\n\\nambitious climate strategy, but other factors\\n Œ \\nsuch as changing market fundamentals for \\ncoal and local air quality concerns\\n Œ \\nalso provide strong impetus for change. As such, any use \\nof public funds to compensate owners and secure early retirements on climate grounds \\n\\nneeds to be carefully assessed so as to ensure that funding is focused on assets that are \\n\\nunlikely to be retired on their own. \\n In all cases, early planni\\nng and social dialogue with affected stakeholders is critical. The \\nmultiplicity of government actors involved in local economic development, energy and \\nenvironmental management makes planning\\n challenging, especially in emerging market and \\ndeveloping econom\\nies, and the establishment of special purpose entities might be necessary \\nto pool various funding sources and manage disbursements on the ground. There is an \\n\\nimportant role for blended finance, along with carbon pricing, in accelerating the closure of \\ncoal\\n power plants and increasing investment in clean energy. The early involvement of banks \\nand other investors is critical to deal with potential external financial exposures. Managing \\nsocial and environmental impacts calls for dedicated and long\\n-term local f\\nocus and financing, \\nespecially in the most challenging instances where whole towns and communities have been \\n\\nheavily reliant on the coal industry for employment and income. \\n There is \\nno single\\n blueprint for managing the phase\\n-out of coal\\n-fired generation b\\necause a \\ngreat deal inevitably depends on local circumstances and priorities. Transitions require a \\nrange of financial mechanisms that are tailored to coal plants of different types and age, as \\n\\nwell as to the varied market structures within which they oper\\nate. \\n The 21 markets that have committed to phase out coal\\n-fired power \\nŒ \\nnearly all are advanced \\neconomies in Europe \\nŒ \\nrepresent less than 5% of the global coal generation fleet, and only \\nseven have domestic mining industries that supply coal for power generation. They\\n tend to \\nhave well\\n-developed financial systems and market structures characterised by high degrees \\nof private participation. Advanced economies also tend to have slow electricity demand \\n\\ngrowth, which enables even modest increases in low emissions sources to displace coal. Their \\nfocus has been on system planning, tailored support, regulatory incentives and capital \\nmarkets. \\n As part of its Just Transition Mechanism, the European Union has capitalised a fund with over \\nUSD\\n 20 \\nbillion to support economic diversification and assist affected areas and workers. \\nGermany designed a similar regional support programme offering compensation for losses \\n Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 61  1 faced by workers and companies, and also has a mechanism that provides tenders that \\ncompensate plant owners \\nin exchange for retiring coal capacity.\\n13 In the United States, \\nregulators have allowed accelerated depreciation schedules, backed by ratepayers, to \\nsupport faster cost recovery for some assets; some utilities are now looking to refinance coal \\nplants throug\\nh asset\\n-backed bond issuance and reinvest the proceeds in renewables. The \\ndevelopment of sustainability\\n-linked and transition finance instruments could open \\nadditional ways to fund emissions reductions through capital markets, leveraging the \\n\\nappetite of pr\\nivate investors for sustainability.\\n In emerging market and developing economies, where the bulk of existing coal assets are \\nlocated, circumstances are often quite different. Rapid growth in low\\n-carbon generation is \\nrequired just to keep up with rising electricity demand, and this limits the scope to displace \\n\\nexisting coal\\n-fired power. Investment frameworks are often characterised by lower levels of \\nfinancial development and higher levels of state ownership. Coal plants are often shielded \\nfrom competition vi\\na long\\n-term off\\n-take agreements. In some markets there are concerns \\nover the potential exposure of the banking system to stranded assets, which adds another \\nlayer of complexity. \\n There are fewer examples of targeted financial innovation in these economies.\\n In China, \\n20 \\nGW of coal power was retired over the past decade through administrative orders as \\nauthorities sought to improve local air quality and curb inefficient plants, but recent closures \\nhave been modest in scale. While China™s reliance on state\\n-own\\ned generators complicates \\nthe political economy of transition, the lower cost of capital of these companies also creates \\nan opportunity to manage the economic burden of closures. In India, where the presence of \\nover 50\\n GW of financially stressed coal asset\\ns has created strains in the banking system, the \\ngovernment is exploring strategies to manage a transition to clean electricity which include \\nthe introduction of market\\n-based economic dispatch and the accelerated closure of the least \\nefficient plants.\\n Effo\\nrts to manage transitions from coal in other emerging market and developing economies \\nare largely being facilitated by DFIs, which are designing targeted packages. For example, \\nChile has a phase\\n-out strategy that is supported by blended finance. Chile established a \\nphase\\n-out schedule and introduced a carbon tax together with a carbon price floor, \\nsupported by a concessional loan from the Inter\\n-American Development Bank; this was \\ninstrumental in bringing about the early retirement of two coal\\n-fired units.\\n International efforts are focusing on ways to separate out coal assets into new financing and \\nownership structures, while creating economic opportunities for workers and communities. \\n\\nThe Asian Development Bank is carrying out a feasibility study with potential host countries \\nin Southeast Asia (initially Indonesia, Philippines and Viet\\n N\\nam) on the \\nEnergy \\nTransition \\n                                                                                                                         13 Over the course of\\n three auctions, regulators\\n awarded around \\nUSD \\n70\\n0 million\\n for the closure of more than\\n 8 GW of hard coal and small lignite capacity in Germany by 2022\\n (\\nbased on publicly available data for the first \\nand third auctions\\n, and on an IEA estimate for the second). \\nThe tender mechanism targets hard coal and sm\\nall \\nlignite power plants.

The World Bank is supporting long\\n-term transitions for coal regions through institutional \\ngovernance reforms, assistance to communities and repurposing of land and assets.

In South Africa, for example, domestic and international \\nstakeho\\nlders are considering a multi\\n-faceted strategic and financial approach to\\n help\\n Eskom, \\nthe state\\n-owned utility, to shift to renewables, reduce its debt load and ensure a just \\ntransition for coal miners and plant workers.

Direct coal\\n-related jobs are set to continue the \\ndeclines seen over the past decade, driven by environmental and demand pressure, \\nespecially in advanced economies, as well as by increased productivity, particularly in \\nAsia. By 2030, 30% fewer people work in coal than in 2019, one\\n-third of those declines \\nare associated with productivity gains in coal mining. The drop is most notable in China, \\nalthough this is mainly the result of continued restructuring in the industry rather than \\nlower demand (\\nFigure\\n 1.18\\n). Coal employment in India, \\nwhich has the second\\n-largest \\nnumber of coal workers worldwide, could be bolstered by the policy ambition to increase \\ndomestic output, but there are major uncertainties over domestic demand, especially if \\npolicies tighten. \\n Although in aggregate energy transitions create substantial job growth, there is little \\nscope to replace jobs lost in traditional sectors on a one\\n-to-one basis with opportunities \\nin clean energy. Rising demand for critical minerals offers some transfer of employment \\nin the mining sector, but these opportunities are not always located in the same area as \\ncoal supply. Miners working at fully modernised mines have skills that could be readily \\ntransferred, but over 90% of coal workers are in emerging market and developing \\neconomies, and are of\\nten unskilled. Most of the scope to re\\n-deploy existing workers to \\nnew clean energy projects in practice is in the oil and gas sector. Coal employment is only \\na small portion of total employment in most countries (less than 0.5% in China and less \\nthan 0.1% \\nin India), but it accounts for a high percentage of total earnings and tax \\nrevenues in many communities. There is a particular need to help workers and \\ncommunities\\n where coal plant closures are likely to have cascading effects on \\ncommunities and supporting\\n businesses.\\n  Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 63  1 Figure\\n 1.\\n18\\n  Changes in fossil fuel employment and energy areas with \\noverlapping skills in the Announced Pledges Scenario to 2030 \\n  IEA.

In the NZE,\\n electricity \\naccounts for 90% of household bills in emerging market and developing economies and close \\nto 80% in advanced economies by 2050, compared to a global average of around 30% in \\n\\n2020. \\nIn advanced economies, household \\nelectricity \\nbills in 2050 are higher in the NZE than in the \\nSTEPS, however overall energy bills are on average nearly 10% lower because of efficiency \\ngains\\n and because households no longer need to pay for natural gas for heating and oil for \\ncars. \\nIn emerging market and developing economies, higher electricity bills are offset for the \\nsame reasons, and so the total household energy bill is lower in the NZE than in the STEPS in \\n\\n2030, and ends up broadly the same in the two scenarios by 2050. This outcome depends \\nstrongly on efficiency improvements; without additional improvements relative to the STEPS\\n, \\naverage household energy bills globally in the NZE in 2050 \\nwould be a third higher\\n.  \\nAs events in 2021 show, consumers are vulnerable when prices rise sharply\\n. We have tested \\nthis by modelling the impact of a fossil fuel price shock in 2030 on household energy bills in \\nthe STEPS and NZE\\n, \\ntaking the highest oil, natural gas and coal prices reached in each region \\nover the period from 2010 to 2020 \\n(Figure\\n 1.21\\n).

In emerging market and developing \\neconomies, households would pay 35% more, primarily because gas, coal and oil make \\nup a larger share of total household energy use in 2030 \\nthan\\n in advanced economies. \\nOn average across all countries, the price shock raises household electricity bills by 10% \\nin 2030, while the cost of gas\\n-based heating doubles and that of oil\\n-based transport rises \\nby 45%\\n.   In the NZE\\n, the\\n additional cost to households in advanced economies is USD\\n 470, nearly \\n40% less than in the STEPS, and in emerging market and developing economies it is 20% \\nless than in the STEPS. The impact of higher commodity prices is dampened by\\n mor\\ne rapid efficiency gains, by\\n reduced direct use of oil and gas, and by\\n electricity having a \\nhigher share in total household energy expenditure (electricity is less affected by the \\n\\nprice shock than oil and gas because of the rising role of renewables). In a\\ndvanced \\neconomies, the price shock still leaves total costs to consumers in the NZE below the \\nlevel of costs in the STEPS without a price shock. \\n  Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 67  1 Figure\\n 1.\\n21\\n  Impact of a commodity price shock on average household \\nenergy bills in 2030 by scenario \\n IEA.

This is especially \\ntrue for the power sector, which in the NZE becomes dominated by renewables with zero \\nmarginal cost, but nonetheless requires a ramp up in grid and battery investments to almost \\nUSD\\n 1 \\ntrillion by 2050, a more than threefold increase on current levels. The cost of \\ndeveloping critical minerals also becomes more important in setting energy prices in such a \\ncapital\\n-intensive world\\n, but these have a less immediate effect on end\\n-user bills than oil, gas \\nor coal prices\\n. \\nSin\\nce \\nmuch of the additional investment in the NZE occurs \\nin end\\n-use sectors \\nthemselves, \\nthe cost of capital to consumers also forms a crucial part of the energy \\naffordability equation. \\n Volatile electricity prices cannot be discounted during the transition, \\nhowever. Fu\\nel costs can \\nstill play an outsized role in price formation even though their contribution to overall \\n\\nelectricity \\nsupply\\n shrink, as in many markets where marginal cost pricing determines \\nwholesale prices based on a merit order where \\nnatural \\ngas \\nor coal plants are dispatched \\naccording to their s\\nhort\\n-run costs of generation. Moreover, the weather\\n-dependent nature \\nof electricity supply (from wind and solar) and demand (from air conditioning or heat pumps) \\ncan cause significant price volatility, whic\\nh can contribute to lower or higher consumer bills. \\nWholesale price volatility is reduced in the NZE by a broad suite of short\\n- \\nand long\\n-duration \\nsources of flexibility \\n(via batteries, hydropower, low emissions thermal generation sources, \\n1 000\\n2 000\\n3 000\\n4 000\\n2016-20\\nSTEPS\\nNZE\\n2016-20\\nSTEPS\\nNZE\\nUSD (2020), MER\\nAdditional\\ncosts\\n2030\\nAdvanced economies\\nEmerging market and \\ndeveloping economies\\n 68 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   interconnected grids and demand\\n-side response).

In \\npractice, however, energy transitions can be \\nvolatile and disjointed\\n affairs, \\ncharacterised by \\ncompeting interests and stop\\n-go policies\\n. As the world makes its much\\n-needed way towards \\nnet zero emissions, t\\nhere is an ever\\n-present risk of mismatches between energy supply and \\ndemand\\n as a result of a lack of appropriate investment signals, \\ninsufficient technological \\nprogress, \\npoorly designed policies \\nor \\nbottlenecks arising from a lack of infrastructure.\\n In the \\nAPS, countries undertake clean energy transitions at different speeds, raising the risk of \\ntensions in global trade and constraints on technology transfer. In the NZE, potential new \\nhazards could arise alongside the rise of clean energy. \\n Investment mismatches\\n Energy transitions bring about a major shift in the primary energy mix away from carbon\\n-intensive fuels towards low\\n-carbon energy sources. Although the share of fossil fuels in the \\nmix has remained at around 80% over several decades, it declines to \\naround 50% by 2050 in \\nthe APS and collapses to just over 20% in the NZE. Lower demand for fossil fuels, and in \\nparticular for oil and natural gas, ultimately reduces some traditional energy security \\nhazards, but it cannot be taken for granted that the jour\\nney will be a smooth one. Our \\nprojections highlight the huge uncertainty over the trajectory for future demand. If\\n there are \\nno further changes in today™s policy settings, as in the STEPS, oil demand in 2050 remains \\n\\nabove 100\\n mb/d. By contrast, if the worl\\nd single\\n-mindedly pursues a 1.5\\n °C stabilisation \\nobjective, then oil demand falls to 24\\n mb/d in the same year. The comparable range for \\nnatural gas is between 5\\n 100 \\nbcm in the STEPS and 1\\n 750 \\nbcm in the NZE. \\n These variations come with dramatically different implications for investment \\n(Figure\\n 1.22\\n). \\nThe declines in oil and gas demand in the NZE are sufficiently steep that no new field \\ndevelopments are required: continued spending to maintain production from existing assets, \\nand reduce the associated emissions, amounts to an annual average of USD\\n 210 \\nbillion \\nbetween 2020 and 2050 in the NZE. In the STEPS, on the other hand\\n, \\nthe annual amount \\nrequired for i\\nnvestment \\nis\\n around USD\\n 680 \\nbillion, well above current levels. If companies \\nand investors misread demand trends amid uncertainty about the future, there is a risk of \\n\\neither market tightening\\n or of over investment leading to underutilised and stranded asse\\nts. \\n  Chapter \\n1 | \\nOverview\\n 69  1 Figure\\n 1.\\n22\\n  Investment in oil and gas production and clean energy in the \\nStated Policies and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenarios\\n  IEA. \\nAll rights reserved.\\n Currently, investment in oil and gas production is closer to the NZE than the STEPS, even \\nwhile today™s spending on clean energy is well below levels reached in both scenarios\\n Notes: \\n2021e = estimated values for 202\\n1.

It is not clear \\nthat\\n higher prices would trigger \\nsupply responses to the same extent as in the past. A strong policy push to reduce oil and \\n\\ngas demand in line with the trajectory envisaged in the NZE therefore is key to achieving \\n\\ndeep reductions in emissions and minimising the risk of market tightening. \\n Market design and \\ninfrastructure\\n in \\nincreasingly\\n integrated systems\\n Many of the new energy security challenges in a decarbonising world arise in the power \\n\\nsector as societies come to depend more on electricity for their energy needs. Across all \\nscenarios the share of variable renewables in electricity generation rises to reach 40\\n-70% by \\n2050 (and even more\\n in some regions), far above the global average of just under 10% today \\n(Figure\\n 1.23\\n). Wind and solar PV generation varies with the weather as well as wi\\nth the time \\nof day and year, and this can cause sudden changes to generation patterns on a daily or \\nweekly basis. A large share of seasonal energy demand is also transferred onto the power \\n\\nsystem through the increasing use of electric heating and cooling e\\nquipment.

In the NZE by 2050, around 40% of primary energy \\n\\nis converted at least twice before reaching e\\nnd\\n-users.

This underscores the need for market designs that \\nrecognise the flexibility value of existing infrastructure even as the focus turns to developing \\ninnovative options that can replicate the services that natural gas provides (including low\\n-carbon hydrogen). \\n Ultimately, secure transitions require careful sequencing to ensure that change in one area \\nis complemented by change elsewhere. A reduction in oil and gas investment requires a \\n\\nsurge in capital spending on low emissions fuels and technologies. Bans or limitations on the \\nuse of gas boilers or ICE vehicles only work if there are low\\n-carbon alternatives that can \\ndeliver the same energy services, ideally at a similar or lower cost to consumers. Minimising \\nthe contribution of unabated coal and gas power plants to electricity supply requires lower \\ncarbon sources of flexibility\\n in their place. These changes bring opportunities to make use of \\nparts of today™s fuel supply system in new ways: for example, there is scope for the supply, \\ntransport and storage of hydrogen to piggyback on existing gas pipelines and storage. The \\nkey point is that policy makers need to understand not just the value of energy, but also the \\nvalue of the system™s overall capacity to provid\\ne it when needed. \\n The world™s energy infrastructure\\n faces increasing physical risks from a changing climate\\n. We \\nestimate that around a quarter of the world™s electricity networks face a high risk of \\n\\ndestructive cyclone winds, while over 10% of dispatchable generation fleets and coastal \\n\\nrefineries are prone to severe coastal flooding and a third of freshwater\\n-cooled thermal \\npower plants are located in high water stress areas. \\nThese risks are set to increase over time, \\nhighlighting the urgent need to enhance\\n the resilience of energy systems \\nto \\nclimate c\\nhange.\\n Shifting geopolitics of energy \\nsecurity\\n Clean\\n energy transitions are set to bring about a major change in the energy trade patterns \\nthat have long been dominated by fossil fuels. The rising importance of critical minerals and \\nlow\\n-carbon hydrogen means that their combined share in global energy\\n-relate\\nd trade \\ndoubles to 2\\n5% by 2050 in the APS. In the NZE, the share rises further to 8\\n0% by 2050 as the \\nvalue of fossil fuels trade plunges, completely overturning the current dynamics of \\ninternational energy\\n-related trade.\\n Energy geopolitics are typically associated with oil and gas. However, clean energy \\n\\ntechnologies are not immune from \\ngeopolitical hazards\\n. The production and trade of critical \\nminerals provide a case in point. Overall mineral requirements for clean energy \\ntechnologies \\n\\nalmost triple between today and 2050 in the STEPS, and up to sixfold in the NZE. However, \\n\\ntoday™s supply and investment plans point to a risk of supply lagging behind projected \\ndemand in the NZE. Higher or more volatile prices for critical minerals could make \\nglobal \\nprogress towards a clean energy future slower or more costly.\\n Recent\\n price rallies \\nfor critical \\nminerals illustrate the point: all other things being equal, they could make solar panels, wind \\nturbines, EV batteries and grid lines 5\\n-15% more expensive, with ripple effects on the costs \\nof transitions.\\n The challenges are compounded by a lack of geographical diversity in critical mineral \\n\\nextraction and processing operations. In many cases, t\\nhe supply of \\ncritical minerals\\n is \\n 72 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   concentrated\\n in a smaller number of countries than is the case for oil and natural gas. \\nThis \\nis \\ninevitably \\na source of concern because it means that \\nsupply chains \\nfor \\nsolar panels, wind \\nturbines and batteries using imported \\nmaterials could \\nquickly be affected by regula\\ntory \\nchanges, trade restrictions or even political instability in a small number of countries.\\n Early \\nattention from policy makers is required to develop a comprehensive approach to mineral \\nsecurity that encompasses measures to scale up investment and promo\\nte technology \\ninnovation together with a strong focus on recycling, supply chain resilience and \\nsustainability.\\n The NZE also sees the emergence of inter\\n-regional hydrogen trade (including trade in \\nhydrogen\\n-based fuels such as ammonia)\\n, \\nwith regions that po\\nssess abundant low cost \\nproduction potential exporting to those with more limited production options. \\nHydrogen \\ntrade grows to around USD\\n 100 \\nbillion by 2050 in the APS, \\nhigher than\\n the value of \\ncurrent\\n international \\ncoal\\n trade, and to USD\\n 300 \\nbillion in th\\ne NZE.\\n However, there is a question mark \\nover how\\n infrastructure and market norms will develop as demand increases.

The stark conclusions on the physical science, \\nproduced as part of the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \\n\\nChange, are reinforced on a startlingly regular basis by headlines of new e\\nxtreme weather \\nevents from all around the world. Since the energy sector is responsible for almost 75% of \\n\\nglobal greenhouse gas emissions, it is firmly in the spotlight. There are signs of a response, \\n\\nboth in deployment trends for some clean energy technol\\nogies and in the increasingly \\nambitious pledges to curb emissions made by governments, municipalities, companies, \\n\\ninvestors, financial institutions and others in the run\\n-up to the \\ncrucial meeting of the \\nUnited \\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change\\n Conference of the Parties (COP\\n26). \\nHowever, the latest energy and emissions trends are a reminder that changes in the way that \\n\\nwe use and consume energy have a long way to go: the world™s partial recovery from the \\n\\nCovid\\n-19 pandemic has been enough to push\\n up demand for all fuels and technologies, \\nleading to a \\nsharp \\nrebound in prices and in carbon dioxide (CO\\n2) emissions.\\n The ways in which policy commitments and technological change must drive real changes in \\n\\nenergy markets is a central theme of this \\nWorld \\nEnergy Outlook\\n 2021\\n. The level of \\ncommitment to tackle climate change has never been higher, but there remains a large gap \\n\\nbetween the data coming from markets and the statements coming from policy makers. In \\n\\nthis new \\nOutlook\\n, we explore how and when this gap might narrow, as it must if the world is \\nto get serious about addressing climate change, by focusing on: \\n  Recovery:\\n With different rates of vaccination and the spread of more transmissible \\nvariants of the virus, how widespread is the recovery from Covi\\nd-\\n19?

What are the \\nimplications\\n for \\npeople and jobs, and for the security and affordability of energy supply? And what does \\neach scenario imply for emissions and for the rise in global \\ntemperatures\\n? \\nThis chapter sets the scene. Its first\\n-half examines our starting point in 2021, \\nthe\\n continued \\nuncertainties created by the pandemic, the regional differences in \\noutcomes\\n and responses, \\nand what the late\\nst data for energy, investment, prices\\n and emissions tell us about the forces \\nshaping today™s energy sector. Its second\\n-half describes the scenarios used in this year™s \\nanalysis, discusses how and why they differ from each other, \\nlooks\\n at the underlying \\neconomic and demographic drivers, the outlook for energy and carbon prices, and the \\ndynamic role played by energy technology development and innovation.\\n  82 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n  2.2\\n Energy and the Covid\\n-19 pandemic\\n Last year™s edition of the \\nWorld Energy\\n Outlook\\n surveyed the\\n disruption \\ncaused to the energy \\nsector by the Covid\\n-19 pandemic and concluded that ﬁit is too soon to say whether today™s \\ncrisis represents a setback for efforts to bring about a more secure and sustainable energy \\nsystem or a catalyst that accelerates the pace of cha\\nngeﬂ. One year on, many uncertainties \\nremain, but some of the contours of the recovery, in different parts of the world, are more \\nclearly visible. \\n In the \\nWorld Energy Outlook\\n-2020\\n, we posited \\nthree possible ways out of the crisis, based on \\ndifferent assumptions about the severity and duration of the public health emergency, its \\n\\neconomic impact and the response from policy makers:\\n  The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) assumed that the pandemic would be brought \\n\\nunder control by the end of 2021, bringing a relatively robust economic recovery. This \\n\\nscenario did not assume any dramatic change in policy orientation in favour of a more \\nsustainable recovery, beyond measures already \\nannounced. \\n  The Delayed Recovery Scenario (DRS) assumed more prolonged outbreaks of C\\novid\\n-19, \\nwith deeper economic impacts. Like the STEPS, the DRS did not foresee additional policy \\n\\nchanges affecting the nature of the eventual recovery. \\n  By contrast, the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE) case and the Sustainable \\nDevelopment Scenario relied \\non a wholesale shift in policy focus and investment in \\nsupport of a sustainable recovery, aided by a relatively rapid improvement in public \\nhealth and the economy.\\n One year on, our assessment of the starting point for this \\nOutlook\\n reveals a mixture of these \\nelements. Some parts of the world, notably those with ready access to vaccines, are seeing \\n\\na robust economic rebound, and some advanced economies are taking steps to promote \\n\\nsustainability in their recovery strategies. However, the picture in many emerging \\nmarket\\n and developing economies is significantly less encouraging: public health and economic \\n\\nindicators point towards a delayed recovery, and many countries lack both the finance and \\n\\nthe policy momentum to mobilise a much\\n-need\\ned increase in clean energy investment. \\nThe \\nsharp uptick in commodity prices in the second half of 2021 could cast a shadow over the \\n\\nglobal economic recovery. \\n 2.2.1\\n Economy\\n and public \\nhealth\\n Public health indicators are still flashing red in many parts of the world.

It remains the case that \\ninvestment opportunities in renewables lack scale and liquidity in mo\\nst parts of the \\nworld, meaning that they are not always readily accessible. But the historical record \\ndoes \\nshow that, with growing policy momentum and cost advantages, renewables have the \\npotential to generate competitive risk\\n-adjusted returns. \\n 2.2.3\\n Energy de\\nmand\\n and\\n supply\\n Worldwide energy demand in 2021 is set to recover the ground that was lost the previous \\nyear, with a 4% increase returning global energy demand to pre\\n-pandemic levels. The pickup \\nin economic activity as countries gradually emerged from lockdowns has meant an upswing \\n\\nin demand for all fuels and technologies. These effects are overshadowing the signs of more \\n\\nstructural changes in the energy sector, notably the rise of renewables for power generation \\nand electric vehicles for personal mobility.\\n  \\nThe pandemic was a setback for the pace of improvements in energy efficiency: strains on \\ncorporate and household budgets, uncertainties about the pace of recovery, and lower fuel \\nprices in 2020 delayed spending on more efficient equipment and vehicles. The amount of \\nenergy required to generate a unit of global GDP has been steadily coming down over time, \\n\\nbut the rate of improvement has slowed noticeably in recent years and was only 0.5% in \\n2020. This is well below the 3\\n-4% annual figure needed to achieve \\nglobal climate and \\nsustainability goals. Investments in energy efficiency are set to pick up in 2021, although \\ngrowth is likely to be \\nheavily concentrated in markets and sectors with \\nsupportive\\n government policies, such as the buildings sector in Europe\\n. \\nElectricity\\n After declining in 2020, electricity demand is expected to increase by more than \\n1 000 \\nterawatt\\n-hours (TWh) in 2021, pushing consumption well above pre\\n-pandemic levels. \\nThe increase in China is particularly striking, with demand already around 10% higher than in \\n2019. The worldwide rise in demand is set to outpace the expansion of low\\n-carbon \\ngeneration and much of the residual increase is being met by increased output from \\n\\ncoal\\n-fired plants in Asia. \\n In recent years, higher output from renewables\\n has accounted for most of the growth in \\nglobal electricity generation. Together with coal\\n-to-gas switching, notably in the United \\n Chapter \\n2 | \\nState of play\\n 89  2 States, this has stemmed the rise in energy\\n-related CO\\n2 emissions from the power sector.\\n In \\n2020, record growth in renewables\\n coincided with a fall in electricity demand, resulting in a \\nbig jump in the share of renewables in total generation, which rose \\nto 2\\n8%\\n, and \\na squeeze \\non generation from non\\n-renewable sources\\n.

Preliminary data show a double\\n-digit rise in global biomethane production in 2020 to more than 5\\n billion cubic metres (bcm), \\nlargely due to supportive policies in Europe and North America, and a further large incre\\nase \\nis anticipated in 2021.

China is by far the world™s largest producer \\nand consumer of coal, and is instrumental in setting the global trend, but is far from alone in \\nseeing higher coal demand in 2021. The increases, for the most part, are a reaction to the \\n\\nupswing in activity, but they are also a strong indication that the pace of structural change in \\n\\nthe energy sector is far from sufficient. \\n Low\\n-carbon solid fuels count for more in the energy mix than their liquid or gaseous \\ncounterparts: almost 90% of the bioenergy used today is in\\n solid form.

Pledges made by governments \\n\\nare central to the architecture of the Paris Agreement and the fight against cli\\nmate change, \\nand the last year has been a particularly busy one for new climate policy announcements. \\n\\nThis \\nWorld Energy Outlook\\n considers all pledges and commitments made as of mid\\n-2021, \\nincluding formal Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as well as other announced \\nambitions, including longer term net zero targets\\n (\\nFigure\\n 2.11\\n). \\nIn the context of the Paris Agreement, NDCs are meant to be updated every five years, \\nbecoming more ambitious over time. Most countries in the world have submitted a first NDC, \\nalthough only around 60% of that number, so far, have formally submitted new or updated \\nversions. The current crop of NDCs is typically focused on targets for 2030, but an increasing \\n\\nnumber of countries are putting their actions on emissions in the context of long\\n-term \\nstrat\\negies and net zero emissions targets. \\n If the world is to stem the rise in global average temperatures, it has to bring emissions down \\n\\nto a point where any residual emissions from human activity are balanced by removals of \\nemissions from the atmosphere. Th\\nat is why net zero targets \\nŒ \\nand the consistency of interim \\ngoals with these targets \\nŒ \\nhave become a central focus of the climate debate.

The context for company \\n\\npledges likewise varies depending on their operations: it is much easier for firms reliant on \\nelectricity, such as technology companies, to take on ambitious targets than it is for those in \\nlogistics or heavy industrial sectors. \\n Figure\\n 2.\\n11\\n  Number of countries with NDCs, long-term strategies and net \\nzero pledges, and their shares of global CO\\n2 emissions in 2020 \\n  IEA.

Company \\npledges also vary in scope: some include emissions from operations, but not indirect \\n\\nemissions in their value chain. \\n 25%\\n50%\\n75%\\n100%\\n 50 100 150 200First NDC\\nNew or\\nupdated NDC\\nNZE pledges\\nLong-term\\nstrategy\\nNZE targets in\\nlawNumber of countries\\nNumber of countries\\n\\n 94 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   Are there conditions attached? If so, what are the conditions that have to be met in \\norder for the commitment\\n (or parts of it) to be realised? In the case of country pledges, \\nthe most common conditions relate to financial support. In practice, many \\ncommitments are implicitly reliant \\non\\n measures to strengthen institutional capacity.\\n  Does the pledge rely on carbon \\ndioxide removal (CDR) or offsets? This is an increasingly \\nimportant consideration. CDR technologies include natural CO\\n2 sinks, such as forests and \\nsoils, as well as technological solutions, such as direct air capture or bioenergy with \\ncarbon capture and storage. Reliance on these solutions can be justified in areas where \\nemissions reductions are extremely difficult to achieve, but broad reliance on offsets is \\n\\noften an indication of a lack of stringency.\\n  \\n Are there mechanisms in place to track progress and \\nensure\\n compliance? These are vital \\nto ensure that the emissions reductions are robust, and that \\ngovernments\\n are held \\naccountable for performance against their targets.\\n  \\n2.3.2\\n WEO\\n-2021 scenarios\\n This \\nWorld Energy Outlook\\n (\\nWEO\\n) explores various scenarios, each of w\\nhich is built on a \\ndifferent set of underlying assumptions about how the energy system might evolve. These \\n\\nscenarios are not predictions \\nŒ \\nthe IEA does not have, and has never had, a single view about \\nwhat the long\\n-term future might hold. Instead, what the\\n scenarios seek to do is to enable \\nreaders to compare different possible versions of the future and the levers and actions that \\n\\nproduce them, with the aim of stimulating insights about the future of global energy.\\n These scenarios highlight the importance of government policies in determining the future \\nof the global energy system: decisions made by governments are the main differentiating \\nfactor explaining the variations in outcomes across our scenarios. However, we also take into \\n\\naccount other elements and influences, notably the economic and demographic context, \\ntechnology costs and learning, energy prices and affordability, corporate sustainability \\ncommitments, and social and behavioural factors.\\n This \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n assesses three main scenari\\nos. One is normative, in that it \\nis designed to achieve a specific outcome and shows a pathway to reach it. Two scenarios \\n\\nare exploratory, in that they define a set of starting conditions and then see where they lead. \\n\\nIn contrast to the 2020 edition of the\\n WEO\\n, we do not vary the assumptions about public \\nhealth across the scenarios; we assume in each scenario that the pandemic is largely brought \\n\\nunder control by the end of 2021\\n in advanced economies and China, but that this takes longer \\nin many emerging mar\\nket and developing economies. \\n The scenarios are:\\n  The \\nNet Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE).\\n This is a normative IEA scenario that \\nshows a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve net zero \\nCO\\n2 emissions by 2050, with advanc\\ned economies \\nreaching\\n net zero emissions in \\nadvance of others. This scenario also meets key energy\\n-related United Nations \\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular by achieving universal energy \\n Chapter \\n2 | \\nState of play\\n 95  2 access by 2030 and major improvements in air quality. The NZE does not rely on \\nemissions reductions from outside the energy sector to achieve its goals, but assumes \\nthat non\\n-energy emissions will be reduced in the same proportion as energy emissions. \\nIt is consistent with limiting the global temperature ris\\ne to 1.5 °C without a temperature \\novershoot (with a 50% probability). \\n  The \\nAnnounced Pledges Scenario (APS)\\n appears for the first time in this \\nWEO\\n. It takes \\naccount of all of the climate commitments made by \\ngovernments\\n around the world, \\nincluding NDCs as w\\nell as longer term net zero targets, and assumes that they will be \\nmet in full and on time. The global trends in this scenario represent the cumulative \\n\\nextent of the world™s ambition to tackle climate change as of mid\\n-2021. The remaining \\ndifference in glob\\nal emissions between the outcome in the APS and the normative goals \\nin the NZE or the Sustainable Development Scenario shows the ﬁambition gapﬂ that \\n\\nneeds to be closed to achieve the goals agreed at Paris in 2015.\\n  The \\nStated Policies Scenario (STEPS) \\nprovi\\ndes a more conservative benchmark for the \\nfuture, because it does not take it for granted that governments will reach all announced \\n\\ngoals. Instead, it takes a more granular, sector\\n-by\\n-sector look at what has actually been \\nput in place to reach these and other energy\\n-related objectives, taking account not just \\nof existing policies and measures but also of those that are under dev\\nelopment. For \\nexample, the new \\nFit\\n for\\n 55 \\npackage of measures announced by the European \\nCommission in July 2021 provides the detailed \\nunderpinnings\\n for the European Union to \\nreach its new 2030 emissions reduction target (a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030 \\n\\ncompared with 1990 levels), and this is\\n sufficient to bring the near\\n-term EU trajectory in \\nthe STEPS close to that in the APS. The STEPS explores where the energy system might \\n\\ngo without a major additional steer from policy makers. As with the APS, it is not \\n\\ndesigned to achieve a particular out\\ncome.\\n An additional scenario referenced in the text is the \\nSustainable Development Scenario (SDS)\\n. \\nAs a \\nﬁwell below 2\\n °Cﬂ pathway\\n, the SDS\\n represents a gateway to the outcomes targ\\neted by \\nthe Paris Agreement. Like the NZE, the SDS is based on a surge in clean energy policies and \\ninvestment that puts \\nthe\\n energy system on track for key SDGs. In this scenario, \\nall current \\nnet\\n zero pledges are achieved in full and there are extensive efforts to realise near\\n-term \\nemissions reductions;\\n advanced \\neconomies\\n reach ne\\nt \\nzero emissions by 2050, China around \\n2060, \\nand all other countries by 2070 at the latest. Without assuming any net negative \\nemissions, t\\nhis scenario is consistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.65\\n °C \\n(with a 50% probability). \\nWith some level of net negative emissions after 2070, the \\n\\ntemperature rise could be reduced to 1.5 °C in 2100.\\n  \\n 96 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n  2.4\\n Inputs to \\nthe\\n scenarios\\n 2.4.1\\n Economic and \\npopulation\\n assumptions\\n The global \\neconomy\\n is assumed to grow by around 3% per year on average over the period \\nto 2050, \\nwith large variations by country, by region and over time\\n (\\nTable\\n 2.1\\n).

Experience thus far indicates that \\nŒ \\nwhen Covid\\n-19 is brought under control and the \\nrestrictions are removed \\nŒ \\nthe trajectory for economic recovery is r\\nelatively rapid, especially \\nin countries that have mobilised strong fiscal support. \\nRecoveries\\n have been led by industry \\nand retail, while other sectors such as tourism and transport have lagged. However, some \\nmajor near\\n-term uncertainties remain. As noted\\n, there \\nare\\n continued downside risks from a \\nprolonged pandemic, with the spread of variants posing particular threats to emerging \\n Chapter \\n2 | \\nState of play\\n 97  2 market and developing countries with low vaccination rates. There are also questions about \\nthe extent and duration of government support, with rising debt burdens limiting fiscal \\nleeway in many countries; developing economies are again more vulnerable in this respect. \\n\\nIn addition, there are uncertainties about the\\n near\\n-term impact on the broader economy \\nfollowing\\n the sharp increases seen in energy prices in 2021\\n. \\nOver the longer term, emerging market and developing economies are the main drivers of \\nan expanding global economy, although a steady slowdown in population growth, the \\npossibility of a further retreat from globalisation and a gradual moderation in growth in China \\nall dampen the advance of global GDP over time. Higher public debt arising from the \\npandemic may be managed in practice by central bank tolerance for slightly higher inflation. \\nThe main energy\\n-related uncertainties for the economic outlook relate to the impact of price \\nvolatility, the size of any near\\n-term surge in clean energy investment, the extent of \\nproductivity gains associated with the deployment of new energy technologies, and the \\npressure exerted by energy\\n transitions on major hydrocarbon\\n-rich economies.\\n The global \\npopulation\\n is assumed to rise from just under 8\\n billion today to 8.5\\n billion in 2030 \\nand 9.7\\n billion in 2050, an increase of just over 25% in 30\\n years.\\n3 The rate of growth continues \\nto slow over \\ntime, despite a near doubling of the population in sub\\n-Saharan Africa. Although \\nits effects are likely to be transient, the pandemic appears to have slightly slowed population \\ngrowth, with China and many advanced economies registering fewer births during t\\nhe \\npandemic. Other short\\n-term impacts of the pandemic include a fall in life expectancy in a \\nnumber of advanced economies and a significant fall in international migration: the number \\nof new visas and residence permits issued by O\\nrganisation for Economic C\\no-\\noperation and \\nDevelopment (O\\nECD\\n) \\ncountries fell by \\n46%\\n in the first\\n-half of 2020 compared \\nwith\\n the same \\nperiod in 2019\\n. \\nA rising share of older people in the global population is an increasingly important \\n\\ndemographic trend. This has not been a major issue at global level: the share of \\nthe global \\npopulation \\naged 65 and above i\\nncreased from about 5% in 1960 to 9% in 2019. How\\never, it \\nis already a noticeable trend in high\\n income countries, and becomes increasingly relevant \\nover time in China and other middle\\n income economies. \\nAside from the economic \\nimplications, older populations also affect patterns of energy use, with higher\\n residential \\nconsumption offset by a lower propensity to travel.\\n Urbanisation is a key driver of our energy projections\\n. \\nSome 56% of the global population \\nlived in cities and towns in 2020, and they accounted for \\ntwo-third\\ns \\nof global energy \\nconsumption and\\n over 70% of \\nCO\\n2 emissions\\n, despite the fact that approximately one\\n-in\\n-three urban inhabitants dwell in informal settlements and slum households without \\nadequate access to basic services (Ritchie and Roser, 2019). The share of the global \\npopulation living \\nin towns and cities is expected to rise to\\n almost \\n70% in 2050\\n, and to grow \\nespecially fast in sub\\n-Saharan Africa and South Asia. \\n                                                                                                                          3 This is in line with the median variant o\\nf the \\nUnited\\n Nations projections \\n(United Nations Department of \\nEconomic and Social Affairs, 2019)\\n. \\n 98 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n  The model of urban development that is followed will have major consequences for the \\nenergy outlook, in particular the demand for energy\\n-intensive construction materials such as \\nsteel and cement. In some advanced economies, the pandemic led to major cities such as \\nLondon, Paris, Madrid, Milan and Berlin experiencing population declines as inhabitants \\nsought easier living conditio\\nns further afield during lockdowns. It is an open question \\nwhether the experience of remote working will affect the balance between urban and rural \\npopulations in the future. \\n 2.4.2\\n Energy \\nprices\\n The economic recovery in 2021 has tightened commodity markets and \\nput sharp \\nupward \\npressure on prices\\n (\\nFigure\\n 2.12\\n). Looking beyond the immediate factors that have \\ncontributed to market tightness, some analysts have pos\\nited\\n that the world may be entering \\na new super cycle, i.e. a prolonged period during which strong demand and some constraints \\non supply lead to high prices for energy and other commodities. The readiness of \\ngovernments to spend on new infrastructure, a pickup in broader business investment and \\n\\nthe increased mineral intensity of clean energy transitions could all support such a thesis. \\nIndeed, the IEA has highlighted the importance of copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt and rare \\nearth elements \\nto a secure and rapid transformation of the global energy sector, and pointed \\nto a \\nlooming mismatch between the world™s strengthened climate ambitions and the \\navailability of critical minerals that are essential to realising those ambitions\\n (IEA, 2\\n021d). \\nFigure\\n 2.\\n12\\n  Monthly price indicators for selected commodities \\n  IEA.

There is no visible equivalent today to the role in the \\nprevious upswing played by China, \\nwhose\\n breakneck urbanisation and industrialisa\\ntion drove \\nmarkets in the early part of the 2000s. There are also trade\\n-offs between different \\ncommodity types: to the extent that there is a surge in demand for minerals and metals for \\n\\nsolar arrays, wind turbines, power lines and electric motors, this sho\\nuld ultimately ease \\npressure on traditional fuel markets. In addition, as noted, there are clouds on the economic \\nhorizon that could hold back the speed of recovery, especially in emerging market and \\ndeveloping economies. For these reasons, we do not anticipate an extended pan\\n-commodity \\nperiod of high prices, but there is still ample scope for price volatility and price spikes, given \\nthe multiple mismatches between current investment trends and possible patterns of \\ndemand.\\n The impact of changes in the energy sector on consumers is naturally a matter of political \\nconcern,\\n especially when it comes to lower income households and certain energy\\n-intensive \\nindustries. The scope and level of carbon pricing is one aspect of this, but there are also \\nregulatory interventions that push in the other direction by holding the price paid for certain \\nfossil fuels below their market value. After a sharp fall in 2020, the estimated value of these \\nfossil fuel consumption subsidies is set to rise again in 2021 (Box\\n 2.2). \\nBox\\n 2.2 \\n As prices and demand bounce back, so do fossil fuel \\nconsumption subsidies \\nThe continued prevalence of taxes and regulated prices that favour fo\\nssil fuels makes the \\njourney towards a sustainable energy future considerably more difficult. These market \\ndistortions dilute the case for more efficient and cleaner investments. The IEA has been \\na longstanding supporter of efforts to phase them out. Fossi\\nl fuel \\nconsumption subsidies \\nare one important element of these market distortions, and occur when prices paid by \\nconsumers for fuels or electricity are lower than reference prices reflecting their full \\nmarket value\\n. These subsidies \\nfell to a record low of\\n USD\\n 180 \\nbillion\\n in 2020\\n, but \\nhigher\\n fuel prices and energy use, coupled with hesitan\\ncy on pricing reforms, are \\nset\\n to push \\nthis amount to an estimated USD\\n 440 \\nbillion\\n in 2021\\n (\\nFigure\\n 2.13\\n).  This \\nrebound to well above pre\\n-pandemic levels is worrying\\n at a time when countries \\nneed to be redoubling efforts to cut wasteful consumption\\n and \\naccelerate clean energy \\ntransitions.\\n Subsidies to oil products remain the largest component of the total, but \\nsubsidies to natural gas and electricity have been the fastest rising. The increase in the \\nsubsidy burden adds to the fiscal pressures in many emerging market and developing \\neconomie\\ns, especially where subsidies are a specific incurred cost (typically where the \\nfuel in question is imported) rather than foregone revenue (from potential sale of \\ndomestic output at a market price). Pricing reform is politically challenging but \\neconomicall\\ny and environmentally essential to put the world on track for a more \\nsustainable future.\\n  100 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n  Figure\\n 2.\\n13\\n  Global fossil fuel consumption subsidies, 2010-2021 \\n IEA.

The IEA crude oil price is a weighted average import price among \\nIEA member countries.

The surplus in internationally\\n traded gas \\nthat results \\nfrom lower European import requirements \\nmeans \\nthat \\nprices do not rise as \\nstrongly\\n as they otherwise would\\n in places \\nsuch as\\n China\\n.  In \\nthe \\nNZE, no new fields or export projects are developed, \\nand natural \\ngas prices fall to the \\nmarginal cost of delivering LNG from existing and under\\n-construction projects\\n, which require \\nongoing investment to sustain the required output. There is some temporary price support \\nfor gas as oil \\ndemand \\nfalls away more \\nquickly than in the STEPS or APS and reduces the \\nvolumes of associated gas reaching the market.

This is not a \\nharbinger for the future, however, and coal markets balance at lower prices in our scenarios. \\nThe difficulty of obtaining funding for new coal supply projects and infrastructure gives some \\nsupport to prices in the STEPS. In the much more constrained demand environment of the \\n\\nAPS and even more so the NZE (where n\\no new coal mines or mine extensions are required) \\nprices\\n simply gravitate towards the operating costs of existing projects. In contrast to oil and \\ngas, operating costs make up the largest share of coal supply costs.\\n Critical minerals\\n Many mineral commodities started 2021 with strong price rallies, with some rea\\nching multi\\n-year highs. Copper prices broke the  symbolic USD\\n 10 000/tonne barrier in May 2021, hitting \\nan all\\n-time high, and nickel prices rose by 50% from pre\\n-pandemic levels, reaching their \\nhighest level since 2012. Lithium and cobalt prices are also re\\nsuming an upward trajectory. \\nThe recent price rallies were mainly driven by a combination of demand recovering faster \\n\\nthan supply, stock building activities, ultra\\n-loose monetary policies and expectations for \\nstrong future demand growth as a result of accelerated energy transitions. \\n The outlook for prices for many energy transition minerals depends on the pace of economic \\ngrowth and on supply responses to that growth. It also depends to a large extent on how the \\nworld™s decarbonisation pathway evolves. In \\nthe STEPS, the markets for many mineral \\nresources may not necessarily be in deficit and may not tighten rapidly, given that investment \\n\\nis showing signs of a rebound. In the NZE, however, the projected level of demand growth is \\nunprecedented, and this is bound to put substantial upward pressure on prices. The level of \\nprices in these scenarios will be determined by the extent to which industry and governments \\n\\nensure adequate investment in new supply well before the imbalances emerge, and also by \\nhow far consumers respond to rising prices by reducing demand and switching to substitute \\nmaterials.\\n  Chapter \\n2 | \\nState of play\\n 103  2 2.4.3\\n Carbon prices\\n An increasing range and variety of carbon pricing schemes are coming into operation around \\nthe world. The main development since the \\nWEO\\n-2020\\n has been the launch of China™s \\nnational emissions trading system (ETS), which immediately became the world™s largest \\n\\ncarbon market (by volume) covering over 4\\n gigatonnes CO\\n2 emissions. There have been other \\ndevelopments such as various reforms to strengthen the European Union ETS, the launch of \\nnational carbon markets in the United Kingdom, and extensions to the scope of the ETS in \\nKorea and Germany. Carbon taxes were also in\\ntroduced in the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\\n The STEPS includes only existing and announced initiatives, whereas in the APS, SDS and NZE \\nadditional measures of varying stringency and scope are assumed to be introduced. In the \\nNZE, for example, carbon prices\\n are in place in all regions, rising by 2050 to an average of \\nUSD\\n 250/tonne CO\\n2 in advanced economies, to USD\\n 200/tonne CO\\n2 in other major economies \\n(in China, Brazil, Russia and South Africa), and to lower levels elsewhere.\\n As with other policy \\nmeasures, \\nCO\\n2 prices need to be introduced \\ncarefully\\n, with a view to\\n the likely consequences \\nand \\ndistributional impacts. \\n The level of CO\\n2 prices included in the scenarios should be interpreted with caution. The \\nscenarios include a number of other \\nenergy policies an\\nd accompanying measures \\ndesigned \\nto reduce emissions, and this means that the CO\\n2 prices shown are not the marginal costs of \\nabatement as is often the case in other modelling approaches \\n(NGFS, 2021)\\n. For example\\n, \\nmany emerging market and developing economies in the NZE are assumed to pursue a \\n\\nvariety of direct policies to adapt and transform their energy systems and so the level of CO\\n2 prices is lower there than elsewhere. Nonetheless, CO\\n2 prices provide an important backstop \\nfor fuel switching and for some investment decisions in sectors and countries that have few \\n\\nother policies to reduce emissions. \\nIt is also assumed that parallel policies are introduced to \\navoid differences in CO\\n2 price levels leading to the relocation of industrial (and other) \\nactivit\\nies.\\n CO2 prices are applied to other non\\n-CO\\n2 emissions, such as methane.\\n The CO\\n2 prices used in our World Energy Model are applied at the point where the emissions \\noccur and so are not directly included in the wholesale fossil fuel prices discussed in sect\\nion \\n2.4.2. Nonetheless, they could indirectly impact fossil fuel prices via the effects on demand \\nand also due to their application on emissions resulting from the direct activities of the fossil \\nfuel industry, such as the energy required to extract oil and gas from the ground. This \\nadditional cost, or the measures adopted to reduce the emissions intensity of production, \\n\\ncould raise total production costs. \\n 2.4.4\\n Technology innovation, \\ndeployment\\n and\\n costs \\n The \\nWorld Energy Outlook\\n includes a very broad and dynamic representation of various \\nenergy technologies and their costs. The model which it uses incorporates the latest data on \\n\\ncurrent costs for all technologies, and then builds in the effects on costs of continued \\nresearch, eco\\nnomies of scale, and improvements in manufacturing and installation \\nfrom \\nlearning\\n-by\\n-doing. As a result, technologies across the energy sector \\nŒ \\nincluding key \\n 104 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n  renewable electricity production and storage technologies \\nŒ \\nget progressively cheaper over \\ntime. \\nThe pace at which this happens varies by scenario as cost reductions are linked to \\ncumulative deployment: the more a technology is deployed, the larger the assumed \\nreductions in costs. Policies play a crucial role in this process, particularly in determining how \\nquickly new, innovative clean technologies are scaled up in sectors such as shipping, aviation \\nand heavy industry\\n (\\nBox 2.3\\n).  The speed of scaling up is particularly important in the NZE, which relies on a much more \\nrapid pace of technology innovation than has typically been achieved in the past. The time \\nfrom first prototype to market introduction in the NZE for technologies such as solid\\n-state \\nba\\ntteries, small modular nuclear reactors, ammonia\\n-fuelled ships, or direct air capture, on \\naverage, is 20% faster than the fastest energy technology developments in the past, and \\n\\naround 40% faster than was the case for solar photovoltaics (PV).\\n The speed at\\n which new \\ntechnologies are developed is crucial: almost half of the emissions reductions needed in 2050 \\nin the NZE come from technologies that are today at the prototype or demonstration state, \\ni.e. they are not yet readily available on the market.\\n Box\\n 2.3 \\n Energy patents start to pivot towards low-carbon technologies \\nEnergy\\n-related patent applications around the world can provide a good leading indi\\ncator \\nof future technology trends. Joint analysis of the historical data by the IEA and the \\nEuropean Patent Office \\n(IEA, 2021e)\\n shows a clear divergence since 2015 between a \\ncontinued rise in patents for low\\n-carbon technologies and a decline in patenting for fossil \\nfuels.\\n4 However, the pace of growth in clean energy patenting has slowed compared with \\na decade ago \\nŒ \\na finding that reinforces the IEA™s call for a new wave of innovation, \\naccompanied by concerted policy support to \\naccelerate the pace of clean energy \\ntransitions\\n (\\nFigure\\n 2.14\\n).  Alongside these headline findings, the composition of patents in the area of clean energy \\nalso contains some more granular insights. The market maturity of some low\\n-carbon \\nenergy supply technologies, such as solar PV, in reflected in an initial period of \\nheightened patenting activity that has tailed off since 2012. Most patents in recent years \\nhave been related to end\\n-use sectors. Transport has been a particularly active sector for \\ninnovation. So has industry, with a focus on energy\\n-efficient technologies f\\nor industrial \\nproduction, including in some of the hard\\n-to-abate sub\\n-sectors such as iron and steel. \\nMeanwhile, \\nthe\\n overall\\n growth trend since 2017 is being led by invention in cross\\n-cutting \\ntechnologies that enable \\nhigher levels of clean energy\\n, such as \\nbatteries, hydrogen, smart \\ngrids\\n and CCUS.\\n                                                                                                                          4 The analysis \\nfocuses on\\n international patent families, each represent\\ning\\n a high\\n value invention for which \\npatent applications have been filed at \\na regional \\npatent office\\n or in at least two jurisdiction\\ns worldwide.\\n  Chapter \\n2 | \\nState of play\\n 105  2 Figure\\n 2.\\n14\\n  Global \\npatenting\\n for low-carbon energy technologies\\n versus \\nfossil fuel and other technologies, 2000-2019\\n  IEA.

T\\nhe main question is how \\nquickly \\ndemand \\nfalls \\nin emerging market and developing economies, which account \\nfor more\\n than \\n80\\n% of \\ncurrent \\nglobal demand. In the \\nSTEPS\\n, \\nglobal \\ncoal demand\\n rises \\nslightly to 2025\\n, \\nbut then starts a \\nslow\\n decline\\n to 2050. In the APS, coal use\\n falls\\n significantly \\nafter 203\\n0, notably in China, and global demand in 2050 is half\\n of 2020 \\nlevels\\n. In the NZE, global coal demand \\ndrops\\n by \\n90\\n% to 2050 and \\n80% \\nof coal use in \\n2050 is equipped with \\nCCUS.\\n  The drive for net zero naturally has strong implications for fossil fuels, but there are \\nnuances across sectors. By 2030, the NZE shows a fall in the use of coal to generate \\npower in advanced economies (90% decline), a fall in oil use in passenger cars globally \\n(40% decline) and a fall in the use of natural gas in buildings globally (35\\n% decline). \\nYet there are many areas where fossil fuel use remains resilient. These include: coal \\nuse in iron and steel production (20% decline to 2030 in the NZE), oil use in aviation \\n(30% increase), and natural gas use in cement production (40% increase)\\n. \\n Minimising \\nmethane\\n leaks and flaring should be a top priority in the quest to reduce \\ngreenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel operations. On average, we estimate that \\n8% of natural gas and natural gas liquids entering flares are not combusted and leak \\ninto the atmosphere; this is more than double previous estimates. \\nFlaring\\n resulted in\\n more than 500\\n million tonnes of carbon\\n-dioxide equivalent (Mt\\n CO\\n2-eq) emissions in \\n2020, \\nwhich is more than \\nannual CO\\n2 emissions from all cars in the European Union.\\n  Count\\nries with net zero pledges need to introduce policies and measures to close the \\nimplementation gap\\n between the STEPS and APS, including to reduce demand for \\nfossil fuels\\n, \\nand \\nstimulate demand and production \\nof low emissions fuels\\n. \\nIn the NZE, \\na rapid rise in low emissions fuels is a key reason why no new oil and gas fields are \\nrequired beyond those already approved for development.\\n  Around 2\\n mb/d\\n of biofuels were used in 2020: volumes approximately double to 2030 \\nin the STEPS, \\nincrease two\\n-and\\n-half\\n-times in the APS and triple in the NZE. The use of \\nmodern forms of solid bioenergy\\n increase\\ns \\nby 30\\n-70% across the scenarios\\n to 2030. In \\nthe NZE, biogas provides clean cooking access for \\n400 \\nmillion people \\nin 2030, while \\n2.5 \\nexajoules \\n(EJ) of biomethane is consumed and total biogas demand rises to 5.5\\n EJ.\\n  \\n The STEPS sees small increases in the use of low\\n-carbon hydrogen to 2030. In the \\nAPS \\nand \\nthe \\nNZE, demand rises more rapidly\\n as low\\n-carbon hydrogen replaces the current \\nuse of hydrogen\\n in industry\\n, low\\n-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen\\n-based fuels are used\\n to \\nprovide\\n flexibility in the power sector\\n and new end\\n-uses emerge\\n. \\nThe pipeline of \\nplanned low\\n-carbon hydrogen production \\nprojects\\n is insufficient to meet the levels of \\nuse implied by cur\\nrent pledges (2\\n EJ in the APS) and far short of the levels required in \\nthe NZE (17\\n EJ in 2030). Shipping and aviation\\n drive large increases in the use of \\nlow\\n-carbon hydrogen\\n-based liquid fuels in the APS and NZE after 2030.\\n  Chapter \\n5 | \\nExploring multiple fu\\ntures: fuels\\n 213  5 5.1\\n Introduction\\n A commonly\\n-heard \\nrallying cry for clean energy transitions is to ﬁelectrify everythingﬂ. But \\nnot everything can be electrified: only in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) does \\nelectricity approach even an \\nequal\\n share of final energy consumption with fuels. This s\\npeaks \\nboth to the enduring importance of liquid, gaseous and solid fuels in global energy and to \\n\\nthe need to transform their production and use as part of the drive for net zero emissions. \\n\\nIn all of the \\nWorld \\nEnergy \\nOutlook\\n-2021\\n (\\nWEO\\n-2021\\n) scenarios, ensur\\ning adequate supplies \\nof both fossil fuels and low emissions fuels is essential to maintain energy security and reduce \\n\\nprice volatility during energy transitions.\\n Efforts to accelerate clean energy transitions present a new and pervasive set of risks\\n for \\nfossil fuel markets, in particular over the outlook for demand and prices. In the Stated Policies \\n\\nScenario (STEPS), oil and natural gas demand grow to 2030 while coal demand falls only \\n\\nmarginally. In the NZE, demand to 2030 falls by nearly 10% for natural gas, 20% for oil and \\n55% for coal. These variations in demand are matched by differences in prices. The oil price \\nin 2030 in the NZE (USD\\n 35/barrel) is less than half the level in the STEPS (USD\\n 77/barrel).\\n Figure\\n 5.2 \\n Consumption of l\\niquid, gaseous and solid fuels by scenario\\n  IEA.

Fuels remain an integral part of the global energy mix to 2050, but there are differences in \\nthe outlooks for both fossil and low emissions \\nfuels\\n between scenarios and over time\\n Note\\ns: APS = Announced \\nPledges\\n Scenario\\n; traditional biomass = traditional us\\ne of biomass\\n. \\nConversion losses \\n= \\nfuel consumed in the transformation process to produce other liquid, gaseous or solid fuels for final \\nconsumption\\n. \\nYet clean energy transitions also provide new opportunities for fuels, which continue to \\n\\ncomprise a large s\\nhare of total final consumption in each scenario. In the NZE, the share of \\nfossil fuels in final energy consumption drops from 66% in 2020 to \\njust\\n over 20% in 2050, but \\nthere is a growing role for alternative low emissions fuels, such as hydrogen\\n-based and\\n modern bioenergy, meaning that \\nthe\\n overall drop in fuel demand is much smaller \\n 50 100 150 200 2502020\\n2030\\n2050\\n2030\\n2050\\n2030\\n2050\\n2020\\n2030\\n2050\\n2030\\n2050\\n2030\\n2050\\n2020\\n2030\\n2050\\n2030\\n2050\\n2030\\n2050\\nEJ\\nOil\\nNatural gas\\nCoal\\nEnergy conversion\\nTraditional biomass\\nModern bioenergy\\nHydrogen-based\\nlosses\\nLiquids\\nGases\\nSolids\\nSTEPS\\nAPS\\nNZE\\nSTEPS\\nAPS\\nNZE\\nSTEPS\\nAPS\\nNZE\\n 214 International Energy \\nAgency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021\\n   (Figure\\n 5.2\\n).

Globally, we estimate \\nthat flares in 2020 leaked around 8% of the natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) \\nthat should\\n have been combusted, more than double previous estimates.\\n3 This \\nresulted in nearly 8\\n million tonnes (Mt) of methane emissions which, when \\ncombined with CO\\n2 emissions from combustion, resulted in more than 500\\n Mt CO\\n2 equivalent GHG emissions. \\nA rapid reduc\\ntion in flaring and methane emissions \\noccurs\\n in both the APS and the NZE.\\n  Reduce natural production declines. \\nIn the absence of any investment in existing oil \\nfields, supply would fall by around 8\\n-9% per year, which is faster than the rate of \\ndecline in oi\\nl demand even in the NZE.

However, hydrogen\\n-based \\nfuels will need to overcome a number of hurdles in order to play a major role as liquid fuels. \\n\\nThey currently have high costs of production, suffer\\n from limited enabling infrastructure, can \\ninvolve large energy losses from production to consumption,\\n5 and, in most cases, must be \\nhandled more carefully than traditional liquid fuels. \\n There are s\\nix demonstration projects \\nunder\\n construction\\n today that wi\\nll\\n produce \\nlow\\n-carbon \\nliquid synthetic hydrogen\\n-based fuels\\n and\\n a further 3\\n8 pilot and demonstration projects\\n are \\nat the planning stage. There are also a large number of projects looking to produce \\nammonia, \\n\\nmainly\\n for use as a \\nfertiliser \\nbut also\\n as a fuel\\n, including some that aim to export the ammonia \\nto overseas markets\\n. \\nA number of countries are exploring options to expand support for \\nhydrogen\\n-based fuels. For example, Germany has a requirement for 2% of fuel use in aviation \\nto be hydrogen\\n-based by 2030\\n (BMU, 2020);\\n the European Commission has proposed a \\ntarget for hydrogen and hydrogen\\n-based fuels (derived from renewable energy) to provide \\n2.6% of energy for transport by 2030 (European Commission, 2021); and Japan has released \\n\\nan interim report on ammonia use in electricity generation and shipping\\n (METI, 2021)\\n.

Plans to offer a\\nmmonia retrofit packages for existing ships \\nby\\n 2025 \\nhave \\nalso been announced\\n. \\nTo 2030, in the STEPS,\\n the uptake of hydrogen\\n-based fuels globally is limited because there \\nare few policies supporting their use.\\n In the APS, 0.15\\n EJ (0.07\\n mboe/d) of hydrogen\\n-based \\n                                                                                                                         4 These fuels can replace liquid hydrocarbons in engines and turbines, especially in transport. It is uncertain \\nwhich specific low\\n-carbon hydrogen\\n-based fuel will be the most cost competitive and attractive to users and \\nso they are generally presented in aggregate in our analysis. The use of low\\n-carbon hydrogen as a gas, including \\nas an input to hydrogen\\n-based fuels, is described in \\nsection 5.3.3\\n.  \\n5 For example, including the energy required to capture CO\\n2 from the air to provide the carbon inputs for the \\nmanufacture of non\\n-fossil synthetic hydrocarbons,\\n well\\n-to-wheel losses could reach over 90% of the \\ninitial\\n electricity input. Non\\n-fossil synthetic hydrocarbons can also be made using carbon from biomass where it is \\navailable in sufficient quantities.\\n  Chapter \\n5 | \\nExploring multiple futures: fue\\nls 225  5 fuels are consumed globally for transport in 2030, mostly in the form of ammonia in shipping. \\nThis is a relatively small amount, but progress to 2030 will be critical to the later success of \\n\\nhydrogen\\n-based fuels. Closing the implementation gap between the STEPS and APS will \\ndepend on major investment in innovation to lower the costs of production and transport \\nand to ensure that new end\\n-user equipment and vehicles are readily available on the market. \\nThere are likely to be large regional variations in production costs for hydrogen\\n-based fuels; \\nimports could be more economically attractive than domestic production in some countries. \\nInternational trade will require co\\n-operation on standards to ensure low emissions intensity \\nthroughout the value chain\\n. \\nIn the NZE, consumption of liquid hydrogen\\n-based fuels in the \\ntransport sector increases to 1.3\\n EJ (0\\n.6 mboe/d) in 2030, most of which is used in shipping \\n(representing just under 10% of total fuel use in shipping at that time). \\n Beyond 2030, in the STEPS,\\n deployment remains at very low levels. In the APS and NZE, \\nconcerted policy and regulatory interventions in the 2020s help bring down production costs \\n\\nand increase use after 2030, with the more global efforts in the NZE having a greater impact \\n\\nthan those in the APS. Large production facilities are developed in renewable\\n-rich locations \\nfar from electricity demand centres, and hydrogen\\n-based fuels are used in increasing \\nvolumes for shipping and aviation (\\nFigure\\n 5.11\\n). They are also used to a lesser extent \\nfor \\nheavy trucks, but electrification and the use of gaseous hydrogen in fuel cells are the main \\n\\nmechanisms to reduce emissions from heavy trucks\\n. In shipping, the roll\\n-out of ammonia \\nproduction facilities and ammonia\\n-fuelled ships increases substantially \\nin the 2030s. \\nAmmonia accounts for almost half of shipping energy demand in the NZE in 2050.

Around \\n0.2 EJ of low\\n-carbon hydrogen is produced globally in 2030, equivalent to 0.05\\n% of \\nfinal \\nenergy consumption. The majority of low\\n-carbon hydrogen in 2030 is produced via \\nelectrolysis to take advantage of renewable energy resources near demand centres in China, \\nEurope, Japan and North America.

The \\nrest is used in gaseous form to decarbonise end\\n-uses. The implementation gap between the \\nSTEPS and APS is closed mainly through additional demand policies in Japan, Korea and the \\n\\nEuropean Union.

There have been major efforts to \\nrestructure the coal supply industry in China in recent years (\\nBox\\n 5.3\\n). In the STEPS, domestic \\ncoal production moves broadly in line with changes in demand; imports fal\\nl slightly to \\n180 \\nmillion tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2030.\\n Oil and natural gas imports are set to grow rapidly in China. Plans are underway to convert \\ncoal to gas and oil products to reduce import dependence. Coal can be converted to \\n\\nchemicals, na\\ntural gas and oil products, but such facilities are capital intensive, require large \\nquantities of water and lead to high levels of CO\\n2 emissions. These technologies have gained \\nsome attention in coal\\n-rich countries outside of China, notably in India, but \\nplanned \\nproduction levels elsewhere are dwarfed by those in China. In the STEPS, around 3.5\\n EJ \\n(120 \\nMtce) of coal worldwide is converted to chemicals, liquids and gases in 2030, of which \\nChina accounts for 70%. In the APS, the need to reduce emissions sharply in China after 2030 \\n\\nmeans that any investments in coal conversion plants prior to 2030 are at risk of becoming \\nstranded assets. Equipping facilities with CCUS could limit this risk. Coal conversion plants \\nproduce a concentrated stream of CO\\n2, which wou\\nld reduce the overall costs of CO\\n2 capture. \\nBut this would still require an additional level of capital expenditure, and facilities may not \\nbe suitable for retrofitting with CCUS unless specifically designed with it in mind.\\n India\\n has seen\\n increasing thermal coal imports in recent years. This reflects domestic \\nproduction and quality constraints, and significant distances between its coal deposits and \\n\\ndemand centres. Imports currently account for around 30% of total coal demand, though \\nthere is a strong policy push to reduce imports as much as possible. The coal industry, led by \\n\\nstate\\n-owned Coal India Limited, is charged with raising output. But ambitious volumetric \\ntargets have run up against major uncertainties about the demand trajectory as well as \\n\\nchallen\\nges associated with the low quality of large portions of domestic coal production. In \\nthe STEPS, coal demand in India grows by around 30% to 2030, mainly as a result of a 70% \\nincrease in demand in industry. Coal use in the power sector increases by around \\n20% to the \\nmid\\n-2020s but starts to decline slowly as wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) meet the vast \\nmajority of electricity demand growth. Domestic coal production expands broadly in line with \\nthe increase in demand to 2030 and so it continues to import around 200\\n Mtce of coal in \\n2030 (similar to current levels ), mainly in the form of \\ncoking coal \\nfor use in blast furnaces\\n and \\nhigh quality thermal coal for use in \\nsome coastal \\npower plants\\n. \\nCoal exporters\\n have to contend with a variety of different possible\\n futures.\\n Producers from \\nColombia and the United States face strong competition from Russian producers in the \\nAtlantic market, while Australian exports often compete with Indonesian exports in the \\nPacific market.

In the \\nNZE, 40% of energy consumed worldwide by 2050 has undergone at \\nleast\\n two \\nconversion steps\\n on the way to consumers. By contrast, hardly any of the energy \\nreaching consumers today has been converted more than once. Markets and \\nregulation need to recognise the new interlinkages that arise among sectors as a \\nresult of these interactions, in particular those between electricity and various types \\nof gas. Maintaining a gas delivery system brings energy security benefits, but clear \\ninterim and long\\n-term sector\\n-specific targets are essential to guide decisions on fuel \\ndelivery infrastructure as countrie\\ns move towards a net zero \\nemissions \\nfuture.\\n  Increasing physical risks from a changing climate have to be factored in alongside \\nmitigation priorities. Energy infrastructure around the world already faces risks from \\ncyclones, coastal floods and inadequate water supplies. These risks are set to increase \\nover time, highlighting the urgent need for policy action to enhance the resilience of \\nenergy systems in the face of climate change. \\n  Trade patterns, producer policies and geopolitical considerations continue t\\no be of \\ncrucial importance to energy security even as the world shifts to an electrified, \\nrenewables\\n-rich energy system. Higher or more volatile prices for critical minerals \\ncould slow global progress towards a clean energy future or make it more costly. \\nRecent price rallies for critical minerals illustrate the point: all other things being \\nequal, they will increase the costs of solar modules, wind turbines, electric vehicle \\nbatteries and power lines by 5\\n-15%. If maintained, the price rises add USD\\n 700 \\nbill\\nion \\nto the investment needed for these technologies in the current\\n decade in the NZE. \\n  New vulnerabilities could also arise from rapidly expanding trade in hydrogen and \\ncritical minerals. The combined share of hydrogen\\n-rich fuels and critical minerals in \\ninternational energy\\n-related trade doubles from 13% today to 2\\n5% in the APS and to \\nover 80% in the NZE by 2050. \\nHydrogen trade \\nincreases\\n to around USD\\n 100 \\nbillion by \\n2050 in the APS, \\nhigher than\\n the value of current international \\ncoal\\n trade, and to \\nUSD\\n 300 \\nbillion in the NZE.\\n  Uncertainty about the trajectory for future oil and gas demand increases the potential \\nfor mismatches between demand and \\ninvestment\\n, while trade flows are dominated \\nby a relatively small number of countries, and most major oil and gas p\\nroducers \\nremain inadequately prepared for transitions.

At the same time, fossil fuel import dependency rises in \\nAsia in each of the three scenarios, and flows between the Middle East and Asia \\naccount for an increasingly large share of global oil and gas trade.\\n  Chapter \\n6 | \\nSecure transitions\\n 249  6 6.1\\n Introduction\\n By \\ndesign, the scenarios in this \\nWorld Energy \\nOutlook\\n describe smooth, orderly processes of \\nchange. Energy markets, technologies and policies adapt to one another and evolve in a \\nmutually consistent direction. Prices follow a smooth trajectory, international energy trade \\nis assumed to be free of geopolitical\\n friction, and the scaling up of clean energy technologies \\noccurs in parallel with a \\ngradual \\ndecline in investment in unabated fossil fuels. In practice, \\nenergy transitions can be volatile and disjointed affairs, characterised by competing \\n\\ninterests\\n, marke\\nt imbalances\\n and stop\\n-go policies. The uneven distribution of gains and \\nlosses from transitions could deepen existing fault lines in the global political economy, or \\ncreate new ones. Change could have sharp edges, and bring energy security risks with it.\\n As the commodity price shocks in 2021 showed, mismatches between supply and demand \\nare the root cause of energy security risks. Such mismatches may be the consequence of \\n\\nshort\\n-term factors like unseasonal weather or interruptions to supply; they may also ha\\nve \\ndeeper underlying causes like a lack of appropriate investment signals, inadequate market \\n\\ndesign or bottlenecks arising from a lack of infrastructure. The basic goal of energy security \\n\\nremains ensuring uninterrupted availability of energy sources at an affordable price, and the \\nbest strategies for achieving this remain diversity of energy sources, robust and consistent \\npolicy and well\\n-functioning markets. Moving towards net zero emissions adds potential new \\nenergy security hazards, and traditional risks do not disappear, though they may evolve.\\n This chapter explores the security risks that arise across \\nour \\nscenarios. It starts with electricity \\nsecurity, which comes to the fore in transitions as reliance \\ngrows \\non \\nelectricity\\n generated \\nfrom solar and wind\\n, \\nbringing with it an ever\\n-growing need for various forms of flexibility to \\nmaintain reliable system operation, facilitated by digital technologies. It then considers how \\n\\ntransitions affect other parts of the energy system, including existing infrastructure \\nŒ \\nin \\nparticular for natural gas \\nŒ \\nas well as the new links that arise through more complex chains \\nof energy conversions. We also explore growing concern with the risks that arise for energy \\n\\ninfrastructure from a changing climate. \\n Further\\n on\\n, we consider changing patterns of global energy trade\\n, investment\\n and \\ngeopolitics. Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, copper or rare earth elements are \\n\\nessential to make tomorrow™s clean energy system work and vulnerabilities in these areas \\n\\ncould make global pro\\ngress towards a clean energy future slower or more costly. Meanwhile, \\nrisks related to oil and gas supply do not disappear as the world moves towards net zero\\n emissions\\n. If the supply side moves away from oil or gas before the world™s consumers do, \\nthen th\\ne world could face periods of market tightness and volatility. Alternatively, if \\ncompanies misread the speed of change and over\\n-invest, then these assets risk \\nunder\\n-performing or becoming stranded. There are also potential hazards for markets as\\n supply starts to concentrate in the lowest cost producer\\ns \\nwhose economies are most \\nvulnerable to the process of change. \\n  250 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  6.2\\n Energy security in increasingly integrated systems\\n Today™s energy sector in essence is a series of interlinked but largely independent delivery \\nchannels for fuels, heat and electricity to consumers. Between the extraction of primary \\nenergy and the final consumers stands a set of distinct sectors that transform fuels, largely \\nto produce electricity and heat, and deliver the resultant products to users. A typical \\nhousehold today might use liquid fuels for transportation, gas or solid fuels for heating and \\n\\ncooking, and electricity for most other residential needs. \\n The energy systems that need to emerge during clean energy transitions are very differen\\nt from those that exist today (\\nFigure\\n 6.2\\n). In the energy system of the future, consumption \\nnarrows toward electricity, which is increasingly used by households and industries to meet \\ndemand for heat and transportation\\n. The rest of the energy system becomes considerably \\nmore complex and integrated, but this process is mostly hidden from consumers, who \\ncontinue to have their energy service needs met through familiar infrastructure.\\n Liquids and gases continue to play an important role, especially as new\\n transformations of \\nenergy increase in importance, for example those that turn electricity into fuels or store it. \\n\\nThere is an increasingly large premium on\\n flexibility as a core component of system reliability, \\nenabled by an array\\n of digital technologies, as well as new interdependencies among the \\nend\\n-use sectors. An essentially uni\\n-directional energy system, where energy flows from \\nextraction and generation\\n through networks to consumers, is replaced by a much more \\nintricate web of interactions. Integration may also occur in parallel with the progressive \\n\\ndecentralisation of energy, with the number of participants expanding and the unit size of \\n\\nenergy technologies shrinking. Secure energy transitions require an understanding of the \\nmulti\\n-directional flows of energy across this complex system, ensuring that change in one \\narea is complemented where necessary by change elsewhere. \\n Efficient use of energy remains a\\n cornerstone of any approach to energy security, and \\nbecomes even more important in clean energy transitions. End\\n-user energy efficiency acts as \\na brake on peak demand, e.g. for cooling, and therefore mitigates the need for additional \\ninfrastructure upstream. A clean energy transition also calls for waste heat, bioenergy or \\nother potential losses or by\\n-products from \\neconomic activity\\n to be put to productive use: \\naction on this front can further dampen demand, but is likely to create integration challenges \\nas supply chains become more closely interlinked. Meanwhile, more robust tools are \\nrequired to manage flows of electricity into and out of multiple sectors as electricity accounts \\n\\nfor an increasing share of consumption.\\n  Chapter \\n6 | \\nSecure transitions\\n 251  6 Figure\\n 6.2 \\n Global energy system today and in 2050 in the  \\nNet Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario \\n   IEA.

But there are plenty of other challenges. The impacts of climate change and \\ncybersecurity threats both pose increasing risks to electricity security, and they will become \\nmore important \\nstill \\nas electricity meets more of th\\ne world™s transport, heating and industrial \\nneeds. Ensuring continued electricity security means institutionalising responsibilities and \\nincentives; identifying, managing and reducing key areas of risk; monitoring progress; and \\nmaking preparations for handling disruptions (IEA, 2020\\na).  Variable renewable\\n electricity\\n Strong growth in wind and solar PV across all scenarios and regions drives a shift from \\n\\nsystems that are based predominantly on dispatchable generation to ones with abundant \\nvariable renewable electricity (VRE) and this require changes in the operation of electricity \\n\\nsystems. To understand those changes, the IEA has developed a framework which \\ncharacterises the different phases of renewable integration (IEA, 2018). The framework \\ncaptures the evo\\nlving challenges\\n1 as countries transition to higher shares of VRE, and helps \\nto prioritise actions that ensure continuity of supply. The framework has been applied to \\nChina, India, European Union and United States for the Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) and \\nthe APS. \\n At p\\nresent, China, India and United States are categorised \\nas Phase\\n 2, meaning that they are \\ndrawing on existing flexibility in their systems, with minimal changes to system operation. \\nThe European Union collectively has progressed to Phase\\n 3, which requires a\\ndditional \\ninvestment in existing flexibility measures, including battery storage and the application of \\nmore advanced changes to system operations. \\n By 2030, India, China and United States progress to Phase\\n 3 in the STEPS, and the European \\nUnion enters Pha\\nse 4 (\\nFigure\\n 6.3\\n). In the APS, each region progresses to Phase\\n 4 by 2030. \\nVRE accounts for most or all generation for increasing periods of time in Phase\\n 4, requiring \\nsophisticated system management and frequent interventions by system operators to \\nbalance electricity demand and supply and to support power quality requirements. \\nUltimately, system operators will need additional tools to ensure grid reliabil\\nity and stability \\nin light of the increased deployment of VRE and could draw on the experience of countries \\n\\nsuch as Denmark and Ireland which have already reached Phase\\n 4. \\n                                                                                                                         1 C\\nhallenges depend on the unique \\ncharacteristics of each country and region, including the size of its power \\nsystem, the share and mix of variable renewables (\\nsolar\\n PV\\n and wind), the mix of other technologies and \\nresources, operational practices and standards, and market and regulatory de\\nsign\\n. \\n Chapter \\n6 | \\nSecure transitions\\n 253  6 Figure\\n 6.3 \\n Phases of renewables integration by scenario \\n IEA.

The volume of required reserves depends in part on \\ndemand and generation forecasting capabilities, and improvements in those capabilities \\ncould offset some of the increases that are required. The sources of reserve and balancing \\nprovisions could also evolve, for example with solar PV and wind providing downward \\n\\nreserve by decreasing their output, battery storage acting to smooth generation patterns, \\n\\nand efficiency and demand response measures to flatten peaks.\\n Electricity systems need to adhere to a set of physical boundaries and standards in order to \\n\\nmaintain system stability and operate safely and reliably. Those boundaries include \\nfrequency and voltage constraints (IEA, 2021a). Traditionally, thermal generators have been \\nable to play a central part in ensuring that systems can withstand and recover from changes \\n\\nin frequency because of their inherent inertia as rotating generators. With the share of non\\n-rotating generation\\n increasing, alternative solutions are likely to be required to ensure that \\nfrequency is maintained within safe ranges. Possible solutions include synchronous \\n\\ncondensers (which can increase inertia levels), battery storage and demand response \\nmeasures (whi\\nch can respond quickly to changes in frequency). Nuclear power can also \\nsupport system stability in those regions where it remains part of the generation mix. Where \\nthey exist, high voltage direct current interconnectors can provide additional support to \\n\\nrespond to changes in inertia levels. \\n The task of meeting electricity service needs \\nat all times \\nwill require very responsive sources \\nof generation and demand that can be operated in an integrated way\\n, as indicated when \\nsimulating the behaviour of selected\\n power systems on an hourly basis during sample \\ndays \\nin the first quarter of the year \\n(Figure\\n 6.4\\n). For example, batteries could absorb high solar PV \\nge\\nneration in the middle of the day and discharge it when demand picks up during the \\nevening. \\nMarket frameworks and regulations that incentivise investment in flexibility and \\nencourage consumers to shift demand at times of high or low VRE generation are esse\\nntial \\nto manage volatility and reduce the risks of supply\\n-demand imbalances (see Chapter 4). \\nSystem planners will also need to ensure contingency for instances when VRE output during \\n\\nthe day is low combined with batteries in a low state of charge. Hydrogen\\n and ammonia\\n, \\ncarbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS)\\n-fitted dispatchable generation and load\\n-following nuclear power technologies are well placed to fill this gap.\\n  \\nTransmission and distribution networks have \\na vital \\npart to play in enabling electr\\nicity \\n\\nsystems to make full use of flexibility resources. Interconnections between regions are \\nimportant in this context. They enable more efficient use to be made of flexibility resources \\nby making them more widely available. They also provide for smoother\\n VRE generation by \\nproviding countries/regions access to wind and solar PV resources across larger geographical \\nareas with more diverse weather and wind patterns.

Most of \\nthe investment in digital grids goes to smart meters and grid automation equipment (IEA, \\n\\n2020b). \\nDigitalisation \\nŒ \\ncombining data, analytics and connectivity \\nŒ \\nhas tremendous potential to \\nmake energy systems more efficient, flexible and re\\nsilient in each of our scenarios. In the \\nNZE, \\nmore than 70\\n 000 \\nterawatt\\n-hours (TWh) are generated globally in 2050, which is\\n almost\\n three\\n-times the current level, and the share of electricity in total final consumption reaches \\n50%. Digitalised and user\\n-cen\\ntric technologies, distribution networks and business models \\nall facilitate \\na more interconnected and distributed electricity system, integrating some \\n\\n240 \\nmillion rooftop solar PV systems and 1.6\\n billion electric cars, and these digitalised \\nelectricity systems feature multi\\n-directional flows of data and electricity. In the United States, \\nfor example, meeting net zero targets require a huge scale up in battery storage and demand\\n-side\\n response, which by 2050 are used to absorb \\na significant portion \\nof the pea\\nk hourly \\noutput from VRE, while also playing a crucial balancing role when output is low (\\nFigure\\n 6.5\\n).

There are additional ways in which digital technologies could help. Distributed ledger \\n\\ntechnologies such as blockchain have the potential to provide secure payment systems to \\n\\nfacilitate electricity trading and EV charging, and to help integrate distributed energy \\nresources, including rooftop solar PV. Sensors, machine learning and drones could help to \\ndetect outages, restore service and conduct preventative maintenance of elect\\nricity \\ntransmission and distribution networks to improve efficiency, extend asset lifetimes and \\nreduce downtime. China Southern Power Grid, for example, has already used these \\ntechnologies to reduce the number of interruptions by 7.5% annually between 2015\\n and \\n2020, while boosting maintenance staff productivity by 8% per year \\n(ADB, 2021)\\n.  Unless well\\n managed, however, the roll\\n-out of digital clean energy technologies could involve \\nunforeseen costs, reliability issues or behavioural change burdens. For example, digitally \\n\\nenabled demand response services could override consumer preferences for heating or\\n cooling set points: this recently happened to some consumers with smart thermostats during \\na heatwave in Texas \\n(Morrison, 2021)\\n. The most imminent concern is the increased risk to \\ncybersecurity (Box\\n 6.1). A successful cyberatt\\nack could lead to the loss of control over devices \\nand processes in electricity systems, causing physical damage and widespread service \\n\\ndisruption to consumers and businesses.\\n Box\\n 6.1 \\n Managing digital \\nsecurity risks and enhancing cyber resilience \\nDigitalisation offers many benefits for consumers and electricity systems, but increased \\nconnectivity and automation throughout the system raise cybersecuri\\nty risks \\n(IEA, 2017)\\n. For example, connected devices and energy assets such as EVs and smart meters could \\nbe compromised by attackers to launch a co\\n-ordinated cyberattack causing large demand \\nfluctuations and imbalances across a distribution grid, ultimate\\nly triggering an outage\\n (Soltan, Mittal and Poor, 2018; Acharya, Dvorkin and Karri, 2020)\\n. Emerging digital \\ntechnologies such as machine learning could help improve threat detection and thwart \\nattacks, but equally could boost the capability of attackers. A\\nttackers are also increasingly \\nusing cryptocurrencies to collect ransomware payments.\\n While the full prevention of cyberattacks is not possible, electricity systems have to \\nbecome more cyber resilient. This means putting in place ever more robust network \\nsystem and security management protocols, together with cybersecurity technologies \\nand tools, in order to detect, withstand, adapt to and rapidly recover from incidents and \\nattacks, while preserving the continuity of critical infrastructure operations. Poli\\ncy \\n 258 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  makers, regulators, utilities and equipment providers have key roles to play in ensuring \\nthe cyber resilience of the entire electricity value chain. The recent IEA report, \\nEnhancing \\nCyber Resilience of Electricity Systems\\n, offers guidance to policy make\\nrs, electric utilities \\nand other stakeholders on how policies and actions could enhance the cyber resilience \\nof electricity systems (IEA, 2021b). \\n Digitalisation also raises concerns for consumer data privacy and security. Smart grids \\nand demand response technologies rely on vast quantities of consumer\\n-specific, real\\n-time electricity usage data, raising important questions around data privacy and \\nownership.

The other half of final energy consumption consists \\n\\nof liquids, gases and solid fuels of various sorts, almost all of which are low or zero carbon. \\nBy 2050, renewables and electricity displace 2\\n70 \\nexajoules (EJ) of fossil fuels in the NZE, or \\naround 60% of current demand, while bioenergy, hydrogen and hydrogen\\n-based fuels \\ndisplace a further 80 EJ (\\nFigure\\n 6.6\\n).

Some parts of the \\ninfrastructure\\n may be adapted or \\nrepurposed over time for low\\n emissions fuels. Refineries could be retooled to process \\nbioenergy feedstocks, for example, and coal\\n-fired power plants to co\\n-fire ammonia or \\nbioenergy. Hydrogen or biomethane could be blended into natural gas pipelines and \\n\\nrenewables used in existing heat delivery networks.\\n Other parts of today™s delivery infrastructure are still operating in 2050 in each of the three \\n\\nscenarios to provide energy services in sectors not directly amenable to electrification. There \\nis growing interest in employing gas storage for hydrogen, for example, although the \\nsuitability of different types of storage sites varies: some depleted gas reservoirs and aquifers \\ncontain contaminants that could react with hydrogen. Salt caverns have particular potential, \\nbut if all the existing 15\\n EJ of gas storage capacity was to be use\\nd entirely for hydrogen, it \\nwould hold 10\\n-25% of the total low\\n-carbon hydrogen produced in the NZE in 2050. \\n There is a need for some new infrastructure, especially in some emerging market and \\n\\ndeveloping economies. \\nIn particular this is needed \\nto enable hy\\ndrogen to be used for \\ntransport purposes and to supply new industrial facilities with hydrogen. New infrastructure \\nis also needed to transport CO\\n2. The NZE sees almost 8\\n gigatonnes (Gt) CO\\n2 captured each \\nyear by 2050 from remaining fossil fuel use and from negative emissions technologies. \\n\\nAlthough none of it would be likely to be moved over long distances, substantial pipeline \\n\\ninfrastructure would be needed nonetheless.

In the case of natural gas, clear sector\\n-specific targets, both \\ninterim and long term, could help to calibrate market player expectations about \\nthe \\ninvestments required in midstream infrastructure, and to ensure that all such investments \\nare matched where possible to low\\n emissions supply options such as biomethane and \\nhydrogen as well as to storage plans. Markets, regulations and certification will need to be \\nadapted. It will be especially important to ensure that regulations are updated to recognise \\nand value flexibility, and that long\\n-term network planning is consistent with developments \\nin other energy markets and delivery systems, particularly \\nelectricity.\\n Natural gas\\n infrastructure\\n and energy security\\n In many countries, natural gas infrastructure is a crucial asset for security of supply. In\\n many \\nparts of the northern hemisphere, where gas provides a large share of seasonal heating, \\n\\ninfrastruct\\nure is designed to accommodate large peaks in demand: operators plan their \\nnetworks around the capacity to supply the entire customer base during extremely cold \\nwinters (with a 1 in 20 year probability), even when a certain quantity of infrastructure is no\\nt available. Infrastructure is also crucial for the supply of gas to thermal power plants in order \\nto provide flexible, dispatchable capacity to meet daily, weekly and seasonal peaks in \\n\\nelectricity demand.\\n  260 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  A suite of flexibility and other options to safegu\\nard energy security are available across the \\nnatural gas supply chain. These options include spare production and import/export \\ncapacity. They also include gas storage, which worldwide currently amounts to over \\n\\n400 \\nbillion cubic metres (bcm), equivalent to\\n around 10% of annual global natural gas \\ndemand. There is also substantial gas deliverability in the form of linepack (the volume of gas \\n\\nstored inside gas pipelines): where grids are well\\n developed, as in northwest Europe and the \\nUnited States, this is an essential tool to meet short\\n-term peaks in demand (SGI, 2020). \\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminals play an especially important role in several \\n\\ncountries in Asia: Japan, for example, has 285\\n bcm per year of LNG import capacity, \\nequivalent to more than twice its annual demand, although its LNG storage capacity is far \\nsmaller. \\n Figure\\n 6.7 \\n Ratio of peak to average monthly natural gas demand \\nin \\nselected regions  \\n IEA.

In the European Union, winter \\ngas demand is around 90% lower in 2050 than today, and the seasonal variation falls from \\nalmost double the annual average to less than 20% \\nmore\\n than the annual average \\n(Figure\\n 6.7\\n). By 2050, only 12% of space heating demand in the EU is met by gaseous fuels, \\ncompared to nearly 45% today. \\nThis \\ngradually weakens the case for maintaining \\nlong\\n-duration gas storage\\n.

This is true in all three scenarios over the next decade, but especially in \\ncases\\n where variable wind and solar PV power are added to the generation mix at a rapid \\npace\\n, and where electricity takes a growing share of space heating demand\\n. The experience \\nof Texas in February 2021 illustrates the challenge: an extreme cold snap and a sur\\nge in \\nelectricity demand drove up demand for gas in both the residential and power sectors, and \\ndemand could not be met due to the combined failure of delivery pipelines and power plants \\n(IEA, 2021c). Such vulnerabilities may become more pronounced: in the\\n APS, installed \\ncapacity and annual generation from natural gas in both the United States and European \\nUnion are lower by 10\\n-25% in 2030, whereas the peak level of weekly gas\\n-fired power \\ngeneration actually increases by 10\\n-15% relative to 2020, reflecting \\na much more substantial \\nrole for natural gas in balancing variable renewables (\\nFigure\\n 6.8\\n).

However, there are still significant benefits in maintaining a parallel gas \\ndelivery system as a hedge against slow growth in building retrofit rates or power system\\n flexibility (where many of the options remain in the early stages of technological maturity).\\n Moreover, there is a longer term case for injecting biomethane into gas networks or \\n\\nrepurposing them to transport hydrogen. In the NZE, biomethane and hydrogen m\\nake up \\nnearly 3\\n0% of total grid\\n-based gases by 2050. This would bring gains in terms of clean energy, \\nbut it would also create new security challenges that would need to be overcome: the \\n\\ndifferent technical characteristics of hydrogen or the dispersed supply of biomethane would \\nhave to be managed within gas transportation infrastructure, and the use of different gases \\n\\ncould lead to reduced flexibility if gas networks were to become less interconnected. \\n Assessing the viability of gas infrastructure in the transition to a net zero emissions economy \\n\\nalso involves other complex trade\\n-offs. Households,\\n businesses and industries connected to \\nthe same gas grid may switch to other fuels at variable speeds (\\nFigure\\n 6.9\\n), raising questions \\nabout how to sequence the decommissioning of assets while minimising adverse impacts on \\n\\nsupply security or overall system flexibility (in addition to equity and affordability conce\\nrns). \\nThe record high spot gas prices in Asia and Europe in 2021 were a further indication of the \\npotential for a mismatch between short\\n-term signals to maintain or even expand gas \\ninfrastructure and the longer term case for reducing unabated gas consumpti\\non. \\n Figure\\n 6.9 \\n Changes in natural gas demand in selected sectors in the \\nEuropean Union and China in the Announced Pledges Scenario, \\n2020-2050\\n  IEA.

On average, network charges comprise around 20% of household gas bills (EC, 2020), but \\nthis \\ncould rise if fewer consumers were to be charged higher fees to maintain infrastructure \\nwhich was utilised less frequently. Innovative financial tools or regulatory interventions such \\n\\nas capacity markets may be required to maintain the option value of gas \\ninfrastructure, \\n\\navoiding asset stranding even as total delivered volumes decline. \\n In the case of China, natural gas demand in the APS increases in all sectors in the decade \\nahead, and spending on gas \\nnetworks\\n rises by 50% compared to 2020, reaching over \\nUSD\\n 8 \\nbillion by 2030. Gas use in buildings and light industry sees strong growth: these are \\nsectors made up of dispersed, less energy\\n-intensive customers, and therefore require high \\nupfront investment in distribution networks across a wide geographic area. Demand in these \\n\\nsectors peaks in the 2030s, and falls below current levels by 2050. This implies either a \\nrelatively short capital recovery period for the investment in \\nnetworks\\n (meaning higher fixed \\ncharges \\nfor households and businesses) or higher tariffs on remaining large\\n-scale gas \\nconsumers, such as heavy industry and power plants, for whom the drop in demand begins \\n\\nin the 2040s. Incorporating an eventual shift to non\\n-fossil gases such as hydrogen or \\nbiome\\nthane could help \\nfuture\\n-proof such infrastructure investments.\\n In emerging market and developing economies, a further challenge in a world moving \\n\\ntowards net zero is to secure financing for new gas infrastructure where the longer term use \\ncase may be uncer\\ntain. Around 70% of debt financing for large\\n-scale gas infrastructure \\nprojects in emerging market and developing economies (excluding China) comes from \\nentities domiciled in countries with net zero \\nemissions \\ntargets (IEA, 2021d). Such lenders may \\nstruggle \\nto value the security of supply benefits, or to predict how they will be valued in \\nfuture years by governments and regulators. Such benefits should ideally be assessed on the \\n\\nbasis of whether any given gas infrastructure helps to displace more polluting fu\\nels, aids the \\nintegration of renewables, supports the uptake of low\\n emissions gases or provides access to \\nmodern energy services. \\n 6.2.3\\n Additional energy conversions \\n As clean energy transitions progress, the resources entering the energy system require more \\n\\nconversions before they reach end\\n-users. This trend leads to more integration of energy \\nnetworks, and it has implications for energy security.\\n Conversions are needed when energy is in forms that are not what end\\n-users want or need, \\nas for example when coal needs to be converted into electricity, or when electricity is \\nsupplied at times or in places that are not matched with demand and must be converted until \\n\\nit can be used. These conversions involve changes to the chemical composition of fuel \\nmolecules or cha\\nnges in the form of the energy, e.g. from electrical to chemical, kinetic, \\npotential or thermal. A wide variety of technologies exist that can be used to convert energy \\nuntil it is needed, e.g. pumped storage hydro, electrochemical batteries and fly wheels\\n.   264 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  Around \\none\\n-quarter\\n of primary energy today is used in the same form as it is supplied. This \\nincludes nearly 40% (around 120\\n EJ) of all natural gas and coal produced in 2020, most of \\nwhich was burned to produce heat for the world™s factories and building\\ns or \\nused directly as \\nraw materials for chemicals. Most of the rest of the natural gas and coal that was produced \\n(around 180\\n EJ) was converted to electricity and heat. Most\\n other primary energy requires \\none conversion step in order to provide useful energ\\ny services: over the course of 2020, for \\nexample, 160\\n EJ of liquid fuels underwent refining processes to be produced from crude oil; \\n4 \\nEJ were converted from bioenergy inputs; and \\nless than 1\\n EJ \\nwas \\nconverted from coal and \\nnatural \\ngas\\n. \\nFigure\\n 6.\\n10\\n  Total final consumption by the number of conversion steps from \\nprimary energy supply in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 \\nScenario \\n IEA.

Fossil energy combined with CCUS is allocated to fossil fuel\\n-based energy. \\nCarbon\\n-containing hydrogen\\n-based fuels \\nare not derived from \\nfossil carbon in the NZE.\\n  \\nBy 2050, around 40% of energy\\n consumed globally in the NZE undergoes at least two \\nconversion steps, whereas today almost none does (\\nFigure\\n 6.10\\n). The peak year for direct \\nuse of fossil fuels without conversion in the NZE is 2020 and, while there is a rise in the direct \\nuse of electricity from renewable sources\\n, \\nthis is outpaced in terms of growth rates by new \\nenergy products, not\\nably low\\n-carbon hydrogen and hydrogen\\n-based fuels such as ammonia \\nand synthetic liquids.\\n Energy products in 2050 that have undergone one conversion step \\ninclude biofuels, district heat, nuclear power and low\\n-carbon hydrogen from solar PV and \\nwind, and natu\\nral gas with CCUS.

In the NZE, some pathways emerge that involve even more conversions, such as the \\nproduction of hydrogen or ammonia from electricity that has been converted and \\nreconv\\nerted during storage.\\n The additional energy conversions featured in the NZE are an integral feature of a net zero \\nenergy system. They are a core means of providing the flexibility \\nthat \\nsystems need in order \\nto match the supply of variable renewables and de\\nmand for electricity at least cost. The need \\nŒ \\nand the capacity \\nŒ \\nfor flexibility in the NZE is considerable. Utility\\n-scale battery storage \\nreaches 3\\n 000 \\nGW, and there are millions of behind\\n-the\\n-meter potential enablers of \\nflexibility, in the form of smart\\n meters, EVs and charging infrastructure. However, each \\nconversion step is associated with energy losses. Some of these are \\nmodest\\n, such as the \\n5-20\\n% of energy lost during two conversions in a lithium\\n-ion battery. Some are more \\nsubstantial, such as the roughly 50% loss experienced during the conversion of electricity to \\nhydrogen\\n-based synthetic liquids. In addition to conversion losses, electricity distribution \\nlosses alone more than double to reach 1\\n7 \\nEJ by 2050 in the NZE as a result of electrification \\nand demand growth.\\n One major role for energy efficiency in the NZE is to offset conversion \\nlosses and thereby avoid a possible weakening of energy security (and increase in prices) \\n\\nresulting from the use of more primary energy per unit of delivered energy se\\nrvice. \\n Each additional conversion step requires equipment to be installed to facilitate it. In many \\n\\ncases, new market designs are also required to link various energy value chains. The web of \\n\\ninterdependencies in the energy system, which is already extensive, becomes much denser. \\nThis raises important questions about how to judge whether such a system will be able to \\nabsorb disturbances or withstand shocks. Given that a network is only as strong as its \\n\\nweakest link, it is necessary for regulators to consider how much redundancy and storage \\ncapacity each part of the system requires. In some cases, additional conversions might \\nprovide ﬁrelease valvesﬂ in times of congestion \\nŒ \\nfor example if two\\n-way flows are possible \\nŒ \\nbut in others they might present risks of failure that could cascade back up their supply \\nchains. As electricity comes to provide power for a bigger share of consumption, the potential \\n\\nimpacts on consumers of a disruption to electricity supply also grow bigger and spread to \\n\\nnew sectors. Such disruptions could arise externally from low probability weather events or \\ncyberattacks, or internally from equipment failure. \\n Ensuring the security of supply chains with multiple conversions requires integrated system \\nplanning, and an appropriate balance of responsibility between public and private actors. \\nThe task for governments is to provide a policy architecture that enables investment choices \\nthat reflect the system value of assets during peak demand periods, without prescribing the \\n\\ntechnological pathway\\n. There is a long history of energy governance and regulation directed \\nto this end, but the rising complexity of energy systems calls for an ever\\n-expanding suite of \\ntools. Government efforts to ensure minimum safeguards may need to intensify, and may \\n\\nneed \\nto include action to set operating standards\\n and\\n support a level playing field for market \\nparticipants, while staying at the forefront of developments in digital technology.\\n  266 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  6.2.4\\n Building \\nclimate\\n resilient infrastructure\\n The increasing physical risks from clima\\nte change are exemplified by a growing catalogue of \\nrecent extreme weather events such as heatwaves, periods of exceptional cold snaps, \\nwildfires, droughts, cyclones and floods. Some of these events have disrupted the operation \\nof critical infrastructure, including power plants, networks and offshore energy facilities. In \\nthe United States, for example, in August 2021 Hurricane Ida damaged long\\n-distance power \\ntransmission lines and shut down many oil refining and petrochemical facilities in Louisiana \\n\\nand disrupted 95% of oil and gas production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico that went \\noffline \\n\\ntemporarily.

These events demonstrate that existing infrastructure\\n can be far from resilient, \\nand also expose consumers to energy price spikes.\\n One particular aspect of these severe weather events is related to the rising intensity of \\n\\ncyclones\\n3, which can cause serious damage to energy supply infrastructure, particularly\\n in \\ncoastal areas.

LNG plants and refineries, a large part of which are \\nlocated in coastal areas, are also heavily exposed to risks from violent storm surges, with \\nsome 50% and over 35% of today™s facili\\nties situated in very high risk areas respectively \\n(Figure\\n 6.11\\n). The growth of offshore wind means that it is also increasingly facing hostile \\nmeteorol\\nogical conditions requiring new turbine designs together with improved operational \\npractices to deal with cyclone\\n-force winds.\\n Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of short\\n-term extreme weather \\nevents, \\nand \\nit is also causing more systemic shifts in general climatic conditions. For example, \\nthe global mean sea level is currently rising at almost double the pace observed during the \\n20th century. Rising sea levels, coupled with high tides and storm surges, have the potential \\n\\nto cause flood\\ning\\n affecting energy supply infrastructure in low lying coastal areas. They may \\nalso limit the availability of appropriate locations for new energy infrastructure. We have \\n\\nassessed the exposure of various energy supply assets to risks from coastal flooding,\\n combining coastal flood risk datasets with \\nthe \\ngeographical co\\n-ordinates\\n of each asset\\n. \\nAround 13% of the world™s coastal thermal power plants (200\\n GW of dispatchable generation \\n                                                                                                                         3 A tropical cyclone is a generic term used to describe a rotating, organised system of clouds and \\nthunderstorms that originates over tropical or \\nsubtropical\\n waters\\n.

Other types of \\nenergy infrastructure are also dependent on water availability: these range from upstream \\noil and gas facilities that employ water flooding to i\\nncrease production through to biofuel \\nfacilities that use irrigation and to\\n refining operations that depend on water for operations. \\nAround one\\n-third of global refining capacity is currently located in high water stress areas, \\nand this share is set to incr\\nease to 55% by 2040. Decreasing availability of water already \\naffects refinery throughput in countries such as India, Iran, Iraq and Venezuela. Stable \\n\\nsupplies of copper, a critical material used widely in clean energy technologies, are also \\ndependent on the availability of high quality water resources. In 2019, severe drought \\naffected mining operations in Chile, the world™s largest copper producing region. Droughts \\n\\nhave also had similar effects in Australia, Zambia and elsewhere. Over half of today™s globa\\nl copper production is concentrated in areas of high water stress, and there is no indication \\n\\nthat this will change significantly in the future (\\nFigure\\n 6.12\\n). The increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and extreme weather events \\nhighlights the urgent need for action by policy makers to enhance the resilience of energy \\nsystems to climate change. IEA analysis shows that around 25% of IE\\nA member and \\nassociation countries do not address climate resilience in their energy and climate plans and \\nthat most countries have scope to improve the level of their policy preparedness. The IEA \\nClimate Resilience Policy Indicator is an initial effort to\\n assess the level of climate hazard that \\na country is facing against its policy preparedness (IEA, 2021f). It is intended to help prepare \\nthe ground for climate risks to be incorporated into planning and regulation for future \\ninfrastructure development.\\n As\\n a first step, policy makers should mandate assessments of existing infrastructure to \\ndetermine vulnerabilities and adaptation priorities, focusing on areas that are critical to \\n\\noverall system operation and particularly susceptible to climate impacts. This\\n would help \\nwith the identification of cost\\n-effective resilience measures. Effective implementation of \\nthese measures could be supported by introducing appropriate incentives to attract \\n\\ninvestment. At the same time recovery plans need to be developed in preparation for \\n\\npossible disruptions. As ever, an integrated, systems\\n-level approach will be essential to \\ndevelop a resilient energy system that takes account of impacts of short\\n-term weather \\nevents as well as long\\n-term changes in climate patterns. \\n 6.3\\n International aspects\\n of energy security\\n In a world where fossil fuels represent the majority of energy supply, concerns about energy \\n\\ngeopolitics understandably focus on major oil and gas resource holders, and on the \\ninternational trade patterns that have formed around them. However, clean energy \\ntransitions bring about a major shift in the primary energy mix away from carbon\\n-intensive \\nfuels towards low\\n-carbon energy sources. Although the share of fossil fuels in the mix has \\nremained at around 80% over several decades, it declines to around 50% by 2050 in the APS \\n\\nand just over 20% in the NZE. This raises major questions about the nature and relevance of \\n\\ngeopolitical concerns about energy. \\n  270 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  Lower demand for oil and gas ultimately reduces some traditional energy security hazards, \\nbut they do not all disappear. Mismatches between the pace of demand and supply \\nreductions could bring periods of price volatility even when demand is declining, while a \\n\\nrelatively small number of exporters with low cost and low\\n emissi\\nons resources tends to \\ndominate oil and gas supplies in climate\\n-driven scenarios, which means that physical \\ndisruptions, trade disputes or other geopolitical events in major producing countries could \\n\\nhave a significant impact on global supply and prices. M\\noreover, the \\nchances\\n of social and \\npolitical turmoil in some supplier countries could increase as lower global demand for oil and \\n\\ngas puts huge financial strains on those that rely heavily on hydrocarbon revenues. \\n Clean energy technologies such as solar PV and wind are sometimes seen as being immune \\nfrom geopolitics\\n. The hazards are undoubtedly lower, but the supply chains for these \\ntechnologies are \\nnonetheless\\n subject to various risks arising from trade in equipment and \\nraw materials. \\nCritical minerals ar\\ne of particular concern because many clean energy \\ntechnologies are mineral intensive and the supply of minerals is concentrated in a smaller \\nnumber of countries than is the case for oil and natural gas. A combination of smaller market \\n\\nsize and higher level\\ns of geographical concentration provides reasons for vigilance, especially \\nas demand for critical minerals rises (\\nFigure\\n 6.13\\n).

The emergence of inter\\n-regional hydrogen trade \\nwould add another international aspect to energy security in a decarbonising world.\\n Trade patterns, producer country policies and geopolitical considerations remain crucial \\n\\neven in an electrified, renewables\\n-rich energy system, with different sets of players coming \\ninto play. In this section, we look at two \\nareas\\n Œ \\ncritical minerals and oil and gas \\nŒ \\nthat face \\ndifferent prospects in energy transitions. We then move on to explore shifting patterns \\nof \\n\\ninternational energy trade and their implications for energy security.\\n 6.3.1\\n Critical \\nminerals\\n The rapid deployment of \\nlow\\n-carbon\\n technologies as part of clean energy transitions implies \\na significant increase in demand for critical minerals. Solar PV plants,\\n wind farms and EVs \\ngenerally require more mineral resources to build than their fossil fuel\\n-based counterparts. \\nFor example, the average amount of minerals needed for a new unit of power generation \\ncapacity has increased by 50% since 2010 as the share of \\nrenewables has risen (IEA, 2021g). \\n In the STEPS, overall requirements for critical minerals for clean energy technologies nearly \\n\\ntriple between today and 2050. In the NZE, achieving net zero emissions globally by 2050 \\nmeans record levels of clean energy d\\neployment, and requires up to six\\n-times more mineral \\ninputs in 2050 than today. Mineral demand for EVs and battery storage increases by well \\n\\nover 50\\n-times by 2050, while the expansion of electricity networks leads to a doubling of \\ndemand for copper for power lines in the period to 2050. Lithium sees the fastest growth \\n\\namong the key minerals, with demand up over 100\\n-times its current level through to 2050, \\nwhile cobalt, nickel and graphite also see rapid demand growth. Copper demand registers \\n\\nthe largest absolute growth, rising by around 14\\n million tonnes (Mt) by 2050, expanding the \\nsize of the global copper market by 60% in the period to 2050 (\\nFigure\\n 6.14\\n). As a result, in \\nthe NZE, clean energy technologies emerge as the fastest growing segment of demand for \\nmost minerals, evolving from a niche consumer to a leading source of demand.\\n The prospect of a rapid increase in demand for critical minerals \\nŒ \\nwell a\\nbove anything seen \\npreviously in most cases \\nŒ \\nraises questions about the availability and reliability of supply. \\nCurrent supply and investment plans are geared towards a world of gradual and insufficient \\n\\naction on climate change, raising the risks of supply lagging behind projected demand in \\nclimate\\n-driven scenarios. The challenges are compounded by long lead times for the \\ndevelopment of new projects, declining resource quality, growing scrutiny of environmental \\n\\nand social performance and a lack of geographical diversity in extraction and processing \\noperations. For example, the world™s top\\n-three producing nations control well over \\nthree\\n-quarters of global output for lithium, cobalt and rare earth elements. The level of \\nconcentration is even higher for processing operations, with China having a strong presence \\nacross the board.\\n  272 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  Figure\\n 6.\\n14\\n  Mineral requirements for clean energy technologies by scenario \\n IEA.

Tightening supplies could prompt various industry and consumer \\nresponses such as demand reduction, material substitution, increased recycling or increased \\ninvestment in supply. For example, a massive growth in battery deployment in the NZE could \\nput substantial strain on mineral supplies and prices, \\ntriggering\\n efforts such as switching to \\nalternative battery chemistries that require less material inputs (Box\\n 6.2). However, these \\nresponses have often come with non\\n-negligible time lags or considerable price volatility. \\nSustained periods of higher critical mineral prices could push up costs of clean energy \\n\\ntechnologies and delay energy transitions\\n, \\nalthough they could help to bring new supply to \\nthe market or spur the development of alternati\\nves\\n. \\n 10 20 30 40 502020\\nSTEPS\\nNZE\\nHydrogen\\nElectricity\\nEVs and\\nOther ren.\\nWind\\nSolar PV\\nBysector\\n2050\\nMtnetworks\\nstorage\\nand nuclear\\n2020\\nSTEPS\\nNZE\\nOthers\\nCobalt\\nManganese\\nLithium\\nGraphite\\nNickel\\nCopper\\nBymineral\\n2050\\n Chapter \\n6 | \\nSecure transitions\\n 273  6 Box\\n 6.2 \\n EV battery chemistries: Exploring constrained nickel and cobalt \\nsupply cases in the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario\\n Periods of \\nhigh cobalt prices in the late\\n-2010s led many EV manufacturers to look for \\nways to reduce cobalt use and develop batteries with higher energy density. As a result, \\nEV batteries shifted away from cobalt\\n-rich chemistries in recent years towards \\nchemistries t\\nhat use more nickel. We assume that this trend will continue, with NCA+ and \\nNMC811\\n7 accounting for 65% of the light\\n-duty EV market in 2050 compared with 35% in \\n2020.\\n8 In the NZE, a stronger focus on innovation and international co\\n-operation leads to \\nan acc\\nelerated market penetration of lithium\\n-metal anode all\\n-solid\\n-state batteries. These \\nhave several advantages over the current generation of lithium\\n-ion batteries, including \\nhigher energy density and improved operational safety.\\n Nonetheless, the mineral implications of a major increase in clean energy deployment in \\nthe NZE are huge. EV battery deployment in the NZE is over three\\n-times higher than in \\nthe STEPS over the next three decades, and this could put a major strain on mineral \\nsupplies and prices, in par\\nticular for battery\\n-grade nickel and cobalt. Demand for these \\ntwo minerals in clean energy technologies is set to rise by nearly 40\\n-times between 2020 \\nand 2050 in the NZE. This could result in price volatility and market tightening and thus \\ndelay the achievement of the EV deployment targets set by many countries. Therefore it \\nis conceivable that the NZE could see more EV batteries with lower critical mineral needs \\n(such as lithium iron phosphate [LFP] and manganese\\n-rich chemistries such as lithium \\nnickel ma\\nnganese oxide [\\nLNMO\\n] batteries), even if these might be sub\\n-optimal from a \\nperformance perspective. Following the price rallies of nickel manganese cobalt oxide \\n(NMC) precursors in the first\\n-half of 2021, several companies have already dissented \\nfrom the c\\nonsensus view that nickel\\n-rich NMC cathode chemistries will dominate future \\nEV chemistries. \\n We have explored the potential impacts of an accelerated shift away from high nickel \\nand cobalt chemistries in the \\nconstrained mineral supply case\\n (\\nFigure\\n 6.15\\n). In\\n the \\nconstrained\\n case\\n, the share of NCA+ and NMC811 battery chemistries falls to 40% \\ncompared with 65% in the base case, and this is offset by an equivalent increase in the \\nshare of LFP and manganese\\n-rich chemistries. As\\n a result, there is lower demand for \\ncobalt (\\n-35%) and nickel (\\n-23%) in 2050 than in the base case. This underscores the \\nimportant role of technology choices and innovation in shaping futu\\nre mineral \\nrequirements and alleviating potential supply strains. It also underscores the potential \\n                                                                                                                         7 NCA+ = A nickel\\n-rich (and lower cobalt) variant of nickel cobalt a\\nluminium oxide\\n (NCA) chemistry.

For example, the cost of lithium\\n-ion batteries \\nhas fallen by 90% since 2010. However, this also means that raw material costs now loom \\nlarger in total cost of clean energy technologies. T\\nhe share of cathode materials in battery \\ncosts has continued to increase over the past decade, and has recently reached over 20% \\n\\n(Figure\\n 6.16\\n). When anode materials and other raw materials are added in, the share of raw \\nmaterials rises further to some 50\\n-70% (IEA, 2021g). Higher or more volatile mineral prices \\ntherefore could have a significant effect on the costs of transforming our energy systems. \\n The \\nimpact of raw material prices on total costs varies by technology, but the commodity \\nprice rallies in the first\\n-half of 2021 illustrate the possible strains if these trends are sustained \\nover the longer term.

If nickel and cobalt prices were to double at the same \\ntime, this would offset all the anticipated unit cost reductions associated with a doubling of \\nbattery production capacity (IEA, 2021g). In contrast, rising prices for iron, phosphorus and \\nlithium carbonate have a limited impact on the cost of LFP battery packs, which dominate \\n\\nstorage applications, because these three key materials account for just 2.5% of final capit\\nal \\nexpenditure at the project level (BNEF, 2021b).\\n It is uncertain if, and for how long, the surge in prices in the first\\n-half of 2021 will continue. \\nThe rise in key material prices\\n at the scale seen recently \\nwould \\ngenerate upward pressure on \\ntotal capital\\n costs by 5\\n-15%. This could add USD\\n 430 \\nbillion to \\ncumulative \\ninvestment needs \\nfor solar PV, wind, batteries and electricity networks over this decade in the STEPS, and \\n\\nnearly USD\\n 700 \\nbillion in the NZE. High\\n material prices would require large reductions \\nin \\nother cost elements to keep the overall costs on a continued downward trajectory.\\n These risks to mineral supplies are real, but they can be mitigated through comprehensive \\n\\npolicies and actions by government and industry. The \\nRole of Critical Minerals in\\n Clean Energy \\nTransitions\\n presented key areas of action to ensure reliable and sustainable mineral supplies \\n(IEA, 2021g). Scaling up investment in new mining and processing facilities is vital.

In the \\nSTEPS, annual upstream oil and gas spending averages around \\nUSD\\n 650 \\nbillion between 2021 \\nand 2030, and USD\\n 700 \\nbillion through to 2050, which is higher than the average investment \\nin the 2010s. Over 60% of total investment is spent on developing new fields (\\nFigure\\n 6.18\\n). In the APS, investment requirements to develop new fields are reduced markedly. Average \\nannual upstream oil and gas spending between 2021 and 2050 amounts to USD\\n 495 \\nbillion, \\nwith spending on new fields down by a third compared with the STEPS.

If \\n\\ndemand remains at higher levels, reduced investment would result in a shortfall in supply in \\nthe years ahead, and this would lead to higher and more volatile prices. Therefore, a\\n strong \\npolicy push to reduce oil and gas demand in line with the trajectory envisaged i\\nn the NZE is \\nkey to achieve deep reductions in emissions and to avoid the risk of market tightening. \\n  20 40 60 80 100 1202010\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nmb/d\\nAdditional in STEPS\\nAdditional in APS\\nWith investment in existing & approved (NZE)\\nSupply with no investment\\nOil\\n1 000\\n2 000\\n3 000\\n4 000\\n5 000\\n6 000\\n2010\\n2020\\n2030\\n2040\\n2050\\nbcm\\nNatural gas\\n Chapter \\n6 | \\nSecure transitions\\n 279  6 Nonetheless, actions on the supply side remain crucial to orderly and rapid energy \\ntransitions. Over investment creates the risk of underutilised, unprofitable or stranded \\n\\nassets, putting greater financial pressure on producing countries and companies alike. For \\n\\nexample, most of the 200\\n bcm worth of LNG projects currently under construction do not \\nrecover their invested capital in the NZE, with the total st\\nranded capital estimated at \\nUSD\\n 75 \\nbillion. Over investment also creates the risk of excess capacity that puts downward \\npressure on prices, requiring stronger policy efforts to offset the possibility of a rebound in \\n\\ndemand. On the other hand shortfalls in investment, which cannot be ruled out even in lower \\n\\ndemand scenarios such as the APS and NZE, would likewise be disruptive: higher oil or gas \\n\\nprices could become a political distraction and a signal to make new (and risky) upstream \\ninvestments, even as the\\ny improve the competitiveness of lower carbon options. Supply\\n-side \\nactions to minimise emissions, especially methane leaks, remain essential in any scenario. In \\nsome cases, individual company actions to divest assets may bring the attendant risk that \\n\\nthe n\\new owners may be less transparent or concerned about environmental performance.\\n Oil and gas supplies in the APS and NZE are increasingly concentrated in a small number of \\n\\nlow cost producers. The share of OPEC members and Russia in oil production rises from\\n 47% \\nin 2020 to 58% in 2050 in the APS, and to 61% in the NZE, comparable to the highest level in \\n\\nthe history of oil markets in the 1970s. In practice, there would be a long queue of producers \\n\\nmaking claims to a shrinking oil market, complicating attempts \\nat market management and \\n\\nincreasing the possibility of a bumpy and volatile ride. Falling income from oil and gas \\n\\ncompound the uncertainties facing many of the producer economies poised to take a larger \\n\\nshare in future supply, underscoring the need for vigilance on the security of supply even in \\n\\na world with contracting demand (Spotlight).\\n  Diversification: Where do different producer economies stand?\\n The pandemic provided a preview of the social and economic strains that producer \\neconomies could face from reduced oil and gas revenue. Although higher prices in 2021 \\nand the possibility of further tightening of markets in the 2020s provide some respite, \\nthere is little comfort for producers in our longer term projections. The decline in oil and \\ngas demand and the consequent fall in prices in the APS and NZE lead to a major drop in \\nhydrocarbon income in these economies. By the 2030s, annual per capita incom\\ne from \\noil and natural gas in producer economies falls by a third in the APS and nearly 80% in \\nthe NZE from the levels in the 2010s. \\n Pressures on producers to reform and diversify their economies are not new, but energy \\ntransitions give additional urgency\\n to the task. For the moment, however, there are few \\nsigns that major hydrocarbon\\n-rich countries are moving fast. The value of non\\n-oil and gas \\nexports has been on an upward trend since 2010, and its share in total exports rose from \\n35% in 2010 to 57% in 20\\n20. However, this increased share was largely attributable to \\nthe falling value of oil and gas exports rather than major strides in economic reforms \\n(Figure\\n 6.19\\n).  \\nSPOTLIGHT\\n  280 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  Figure\\n 6.\\n19\\n  Progress with economic and energy diversification in \\nselected producer economies \\n IEA.

This poses important \\nquestions about infrastructure, market norms and energy security (Box\\n 6.3). It also poses \\nquestions about which currency will be used for pricing and trading hydrogen and some \\n\\ncritical minerals.\\n Box\\n 6.3 \\n Trading up: Creating an international market for hydrogen  \\nHigher levels of low\\n-carbon energy use in our scenari\\nos create incentives for new forms \\nof energy trade, and trade in hydrogen \\nŒ \\nincluding hydrogen\\n-based fuels such as \\nammonia \\nŒ \\nlooks set to increase. However, experience with establishing efficient \\ninternational markets, especially for seaborne goods, sugges\\nts that the requisite \\ninfrastructure, standardisation and regulatory measures may take time to be developed \\nand harmonised.\\n Practically all of the hydrogen and hydrogen\\n-based fuels traded today are produced from \\nfossil fuels without CCUS. International trade in hydrogen is limited, with only a small \\nnumber of cross\\n-border pipelines. Around half a million tonnes of hydrogen with a value \\nof around USD\\n 200 \\nmillion was exported in 2019. The biggest exporters were \\nNetherlands, Canada, Belgium, Sweden, France and\\n Germany. Most exports were made \\nby pipeline, with Canada being the only major road\\n-based exporter. By contrast, the \\nglobal anhydrous ammonia market, mostly for use in fertilisers, is thirty\\n-times more \\nvaluable, with traded volumes equivalent to over 2\\n Mt \\nhydrogen. Most ammonia is \\ntraded by rail or sea. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Indonesia, Canada and Malaysia were the \\nbiggest exporters in 2019. As with natural gas, pipeline transport offers the lowest cost \\ntrade route where it is feasible, and can readily be used for hydrogen converted to \\nsynthetic methane. However, pipelines could face competition from high voltage \\ntransport of electricity for direct use or as an electrolyser input in some cases. \\n The regions that stand to benefit most from future low\\n-carbon hydrogen imports are \\ntoday™s importers of fossil energy. The most salient examples are Japan and Korea, which \\nhave ambitions to use low\\n-carbon energy at a rate that is likely to quickly outpace their \\nability to meet\\n demand locally. In the APS, Japan™s demand\\n for hydrogen and ammonia \\npasses the level that can be competitively produced domestically before 2030, and \\nimports rise to 1.3\\n EJ by 2050, equivalent to 11\\n Mt hydrogen per year.\\n Careful co\\n-ordination and dialogue will be essential to bring forward new supply chains \\nin a timely way. Many potential exporters do not yet have climate policy commitments \\non a par with countries whose policy pledges imply a future role for low\\n-carbon hydrogen \\n 284 International Energy Agency\\n | \\nWorld Energy Outlook 2021 \\n  imports. Japan has engaged in dialogue with a number of countries, incl\\nuding Brunei, \\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE, while Australia and Chile have developed plans to invest in \\nexport infrastructure. Korea and European countries also stand to gain from engaging \\ncountries, including those in the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America, to ensure \\nthat all countries have a shared stake in rapid clean energy transitions. Support measures \\nsuch as long\\n-term contracts will initially be essential if\\n exporting\\n countries are to invest \\nin large\\n-scale hydrogen production, storage and port infrastructure, or where possible to \\nrepurpose existing pipelines, and if importing countries are to be able to rely on imports \\nfor secure supplies.\\n In the APS, exports of hydrogen and hydrogen\\n-based fuels from the Middle East reach \\nthe equivalent of around\\n 13 \\nMt hydrogen per year, or 1\\n million barrels per day (mb/d). \\nThis helps in part to offset the decline in fossil fuel export revenues, but also means that \\nnew supply investments are required at a time when budgets are under pressure. The \\nreliability of th\\nese new supply routes will also depend on how exporters manage the \\nbroader diversification of their economies. \\n While some international trade takes place overland in our scenarios, the biggest \\nimport/export opportunities lie in connecting countries with d\\nifferent climates and \\ngeologies by shipping. There are competing options for shipping hydrogen with different \\nefficiencies and maturities. The first demonstration vessel for liquefied hydrogen at \\n253 °\\nC (90\\n °C colder than LNG) has recently been constructed\\n with Japanese government \\nco-funding. For applications that can use the ammonia directly, such as power plants, \\nthere is an emerging consensus that conversion to ammonia is the most promising means \\nof transporting hydrogen over long distances, especially where pipelines are not viable. \\nIn all cases, infrastructure and certification norms for low\\n-carbon cargoes need to be \\nestablished this decade.\\n Many commentators point to the LNG market as a useful precedent and the parallels are \\nstriking: the technology wa\\ns pioneered in the 1960s by companies working under the \\nmandate of potential importer countries and in collaboration with potential exporters \\n(with France, for example, working with Algeria on the development of facilities \\noverseas), while the Japanese gov\\nernment was instrumental in facilitating the long\\n-term \\nbilateral contracts that allowed the industry to scale up from the 1990s and reduce \\ntransport costs. However, given that liquefaction and safe handling is less technically \\nchallenging for natural gas t\\nhan it is for hydrogen, it is sobering to note that it took several \\ndecades to reach the point where very long\\n-distance (so\\n-called inter\\n-basin) trade was \\npossible, and 60 years until global liquefaction capacity could process LNG equivalent to \\nJapan™s tota\\nl primary energy supply (which is around 10% of global gas demand).\\n Countries pursuing climate policies that would make imports of hydrogen and hydrogen\\n-based fuel attractive have strong incentives to co\\n-operate to ensure that hydrogen \\nsupplies do not become a bottleneck for energy security. Near\\n-term objectives should \\ninc\\nlude discussions between bilateral trading partners on whether new sources of \\n Chapter \\n6 | \\nSecure transitions\\n 285  6 financing are needed for export infrastructure and how to align policies that increase \\ndemand for hydrogen with the timetable for exports, for example by prioritising the \\nmarket \\nfor fuels for which there is existing shipping capacity. Current demand for ships \\nthat can handle ammonia, for example, is often seasonal (in line with fertiliser use), and \\nit may be possible to maximise their use by adding cargoes for energy applications.\\n However, it is important that such bilateral discussions and contracts do not preclude the \\nintroduction by commodity traders of more international liquidity and trading over time \\nas the market develops.\\n Critical mineral supply chains are set to involve multiple stakeholders since resource \\nendowments, equipment manufacturing locations and consumption patterns are varied and \\n\\ncomplex. At present, Chile, Peru, Australia and Canada are among the top exporters of critical \\nminerals and China, Japan, Korea and the European Union are major importers (\\nFigure\\n 6.22\\n). As\\n China has a decisive share in refining operations, around half of raw material trade flows \\nto Chi\\nna. Somewhat counterintuitively, China also imports processed materials, highlighting \\nthe scale of the country™s role in clean energy technology manufacturing. How these trade \\nflows evolve is an open question, and the answer will depend in large measure on\\n countries™ \\nindustrial policies or strategic initiatives to ensure security of supply.

Today™s major importers, notably \\ndeveloping economies in Asia, continue to import significant volumes in the APS, so the \\n\\nvolume of oil products traded internationally keeps rising despite the reduction in overall \\n\\ndemand. Nevertheless, the decline in oil demand means that the window for new investment \\n\\ndecisions in refining capacity, beyond those that are already approved, becomes increasingly \\n\\nsmall in this scenario. In the NZE, a broad\\n-based\\n plunge \\nin demand means that export\\n-oriented refiners face much greater challenges in finding outlets as domestic refineries seek \\n\\nto ensure that they meet as much of the remaining demand as they can. \\n A similar concentration of trade flows towards Asia is also seen for natural gas. In the STEPS, \\ninter\\n-regional natural gas trade rises by 40% between 2020 and 2050, reaching over \\n1 200 \\nbcm, with emerging Asian markets leading growth. In the APS, there is still a rise of \\n20% to 2030, but this is followed by a s\\nlow decline after 2030 as growth moderates in places \\nsuch as\\n China and India, while Europe and Japan sharply reduce their imports as natural gas \\ndemand falls. In the NZE, import requirements peak before 2030 and fall below 400\\n bcm by \\n2050.  \\nFigure\\n 6.\\n24\\n  Natural gas import requirements by scenario\\n  IEA.

These divergent trajectories illustrate the difficulties buyers have \\n\\nin agreeing to long\\n-term offtake contracts, especially\\n those that can underpin investment \\ndecisions for new projects.\\n While\\n contracts with minimum offtake commitments provide \\nsome measure of security of supply, there is also a risk of procuring volumes that may not be \\n\\nneeded in future. A combination of f\\nlexib\\nle contracting and a vibrant spot market could give \\nproject sponsors confidence about finding an outlet for production. However, sufficient \\n\\nliquidity in the market would be required to ensure that investment decisions are made \\n\\naccording to price signals th\\nat accurately reflect long\\n-term supply\\n-demand fundamentals in \\neach region. \\n Eu\\nrope™s waning demand for natural gas in clean energy transitions has important \\nimplications for global gas trade. At present the region™s large storage and import capacity \\nhelps to absorb surpluses and manage deficits of globally traded gas. In the absence of this \\n\\nrelease valve, pressure would grow on producers to provide more flexible gas supplies. There \\n\\nwould also be pressure on importers, primarily in Asia, to develop storage or agree flexible \\n\\ncontracts with consumers further downstream. \\n Conclusion\\n An evolving energy system calls for an evolving approach to energy se\\ncurity\\n, maintaining \\nclose vigilance on the traditional risks while broadening horizons to encompass new potential \\nhazards, based on a clear understanding about the way that security is being reshaped by \\nclean energy transitions. Our analysis highlights the\\n issues in play. A core concern is the \\npossibility of investment imbalances and mismatches as the world moves forward with the \\n\\ntransformation of the energy sector. Signals from policy\\n makers to those making investment \\ndecisions are often not clear, or can change rapidly; the implementation of declared \\n\\nobjectives can face delays, societal pressures can add momentum to transitions, or rule out \\ntechnology options or new infrastructure in ways that slow them down; companies can \\nmisread the signals or simply shy\\n away from investment in the face of increased uncertainty. \\nThe road to a zero\\n-emissions system could well be a bumpy one. \\n As the \\nworld demand\\ns \\nless oil, it may also see supply and trade being concentrated in a \\nsmaller number of producers who are themselv\\nes facing difficult transitions as traditional \\n\\nrevenues \\ndecline\\n. \\nAn electrified and renewables\\n-rich energy system requires much more \\nflexibility in power systems, which cannot be taken for granted, while creating new linkages \\n\\nwith other aspects of energy s\\nupply \\nŒ \\nnotably the delivery and storage of different kinds of \\ngases. Digital technologies can help to manage the complexities of a more integrated energy \\n\\nsystem, but they also create concerns about cybersecurity. Critical minerals become a major \\n\\nnew eleme\\nnt in secure transitions, with demand increasing multiple times from today™s \\n\\nlevels, and many potential bottlenecks could emerge as deployment of solar, wind, batteries, \\nelectrolysers and EVs ramp up. Last, but not least, access to reliable and affordable \\nenergy, \\nand attention to the social and economic consequences of change, are preconditions for \\n\\nmaintaining public support for the transformation of the energy sector. The IEA, drawing on \\n\\nits longstanding and deep expertise in all aspects of energy security, is committed to support \\n\\ntransitions that are secure, people\\n-centred, affordable and rapid.\\n

These \\nscenarios are not predictions \\nŒ \\nthe IEA does not have a single view o\\nn the future of \\nthe \\nenergy \\nsystem. In contrast to the 2020 edition of the \\nWEO\\n, we do not vary the assumptions about \\npublic health and economic recovery implications across the scenarios. The scenarios are:\\n  The \\nNet \\nZero\\n Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)\\n show\\ns a narrow but achievable pathway \\nfor the global energy sector to achieve net zero CO\\n2 emissions by 2050, with advanced \\neconomies \\nreaching\\n net zero emissions in advance of others. This scenario also meets \\nkey energy\\n-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular \\nachieving universal energy access by 2030. The NZE does not rely on emissions \\nreductions from outside the energy sector to achieve its goals, but \\nassumes\\n that non\\n-energy emissions will be reduced in the same proportion as\\n energy emissions. It is \\nconsistent with limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\\n °C without a temperature \\novershoot (with a 50% probability). \\n  The \\nAnnounced Pledges Scenario (APS)\\n takes account of all of the climate commitments \\nmade by governments around the world, including Nationally Determined Contributions \\n\\nas well as longer term net zero targets, and assumes that they will be met in full and on \\ntime. The global trends in this scenario represent the \\ncumulative\\n extent of the world™s \\nambition to tackle\\n climate change as of mid\\n-2021. The remaining difference in global \\nemissions between the APS and the goals in the NZE or the Sustainable Development \\n\\nScenario shows the ﬁambition gapﬂ that needs to be closed to achieve the goals agreed \\nin the \\nParis \\nAgreemen\\nt in 201\\n5. \\n The\\n Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)\\n does not take for granted that governments will \\nreach all announced goals. Instead, the STEPS explores where the energy system might \\n\\ngo without additional policy \\nimplementation\\n. As with the APS, it is not des\\nigned to \\nachieve a particular outcome.\\n It takes a granular, sector\\n-by\\n-sector \\nlook\\n at existing \\npolicies and measures and those under development.\\n The remaining difference in global \\nemissions between the STEPS and the APS, represents the ﬁimplementation gapﬂ\\n that \\nneeds to be closed for countries to achieve their announced decarbonisation targets.\\n  The \\nSustainable Development Scenario (SDS)\\n is a \\nﬁwell below 2\\n °Cﬂ pathway\\n, and\\n represents a gateway to \\nachieving \\nthe outcomes targ\\neted by the Paris Agreement.

Resource estimates are subject to a considerable degree of \\n\\nuncertainty, as well as the distinction in the analysis between conventional and \\nunconventional resource types. \\n  Overall, the remaining technical recoverable resources of fossil fuels remain almost \\nunchanged from \\nthe\\n World Energy Outlook\\n-2020\\n. \\nAll fuels are at a level comfortably \\nsufficient to meet the projections of\\n global \\nenergy \\ndemand growth to 20\\n50 in all \\nscenarios. \\n  The Covid\\n-19 pandemic has slowed exploration and reserve replacement ratios, \\nalthough there has been an upward revision to \\nthe \\nMiddle East proven reserves by \\naround 50 billion barrels compared with th\\ne \\nWEO\\n-2020\\n. \\nRemaining technically \\nrecoverable\\n resources of US tight oil (crude plus condensate) in th\\nis\\n Outlook\\n are \\nunchanged,\\n totalling\\n more than \\n200 \\nbillion barrels\\n. N\\natural gas resource numbers \\nremain\\n broadly similar to those of last year. Most of the proven reserves lie in the Middle \\nEast and Eurasia. \\n  World coal resources are made up of various types of coal\\n: \\naround 80% is steam and \\ncoking coal and the remainder is lignite\\n. Coal resources\\n are more \\nava\\nilable in parts of \\nthe world without substantial gas and oil resources, notably in Asia.\\n  \\n Overall, the gradual depletion of resources (at a pace that varies by scenario) means that \\n\\noperators have to develop more difficult and complex reservoirs. This tends\\n to push up \\nproduction costs over time, although this effect is offset by the assumed continuous \\nadoption of new, more efficient production technologies and practices.\\n   Annex\\n B\\n | \\nDesign of the scenarios\\n 333  B B.4\\n Electricity \\ngeneration\\n technology costs\\n Table B\\n.4a\\n  Technology costs in selected regions in the  \\nStated Policies Scenario \\n Capital costs\\n (USD/kW)\\n  Capacity factor\\n (%)\\n  Fuel, CO\\n2  \\nand O&M\\n (USD/MWh)\\n  LCOE\\n (USD/MWh)\\n  VALCOE\\n (USD/MWh)\\n   \\n2020 2030 2050  2020 2030 2050  2020 2030 2050  2020 2030 2050  2020 2030 2050 United States\\n                    Nuclear \\n 5 \\n000 4 \\n800 4 \\n500  90 90 90  30 30 30  105 100 95  105 100 95 Coal \\n 2 \\n100 2 \\n100 2 \\n100  50 60 60  25 25 25  75 70 70  75 70 65 Gas CCGT \\n 1 \\n000 1 \\n000 1 \\n000  50 45 40  30 35 40  50 65 70  50 60 60 Solar PV \\n 1 \\n100 710 530  21 22 22  10 10 10  50 30 30  55 40 45 Wind\\n onshore\\n 1 \\n390 1 \\n310 1 \\n270  42 43 44  10 10 10  35 30 30  35 35 40 Wind\\n offshore\\n 4 \\n040 2 \\n560 1920  42 46 48  35 25 15  115 70 55  110 70 60 European Union\\n                   Nuclear \\n 6 \\n600 5 \\n100 4 \\n500  75 75 75  35 35 35  150 125 110  145 125 110 Coal \\n 2 \\n000 2 \\n000 2 \\n000  35 40 40  90 120 135  170 185 200  160 165 165 Gas CCGT \\n 1 \\n000 1 \\n000 1 \\n000  45 35 25  80 105 115  110 140 170  100 115 115 Solar PV \\n 840 550 430  13 14 14  10 10 10  55 40 30  60 70 70 Wind\\n onshore\\n 1 \\n500 1 \\n420 1 \\n370  29 29 30  15 15 15  50 45 45  55 60 60 Wind\\n offshore\\n 3 \\n480 2 \\n260 1 \\n720  51 55 58  15 10 10  75 45 35  75 50 45 China\\n                    Nuclear \\n 2 \\n800 2 \\n800 2 \\n500  80 80 80  25 25 25  65 65 60  65 65 60 Coal \\n 800 800 800  55 45 40  45 60 75  60 80 95  60 70 70 Gas CCGT \\n 560 560 560  25 20 20  80 90 100  100 120 130  90 105 95 Solar PV \\n 650 420 310  17 18 19  10 5 \\n5 \\n 35 20 15  40 45 50 Wind\\n onshore\\n 1 \\n260 1 \\n190 1 \\n140  26 27 27  15 15 10  50 45 40  50 50 45 Wind\\n offshore\\n 2 \\n960 1 \\n860 1 \\n280  34 40 43  25 15 10  100 55 35  100 60 40 India\\n                    Nuclear \\n 2 \\n800 2 \\n800 2 \\n800  75 80 80  30 30 30  70 70 70  70 70 70 Coal \\n 1 \\n200 1 \\n200 1 \\n200  60 60 50  30 35 30  55 55 55  55 55 50 Gas CCGT \\n 700 700 700  45 50 45  75 75 80  90 90 95  90 80 75 Solar PV \\n 600 380 270  20 21 21  5 \\n5 \\n5 \\n 35 20 15  40 35 55 Wind\\n onshore\\n 1 \\n040 1 \\n020 1 \\n000  26 28 29  10 10 10  50 45 40  55 50 50 Wind\\n offshore\\n 2 \\n980 1960 1 \\n440  32 36 38  25 20 15  135 80 55  135 85 65 Notes:\\n  O&M = operation and \\nmaintenance\\n; LCOE = levelised cost of electricity; VALCOE =\\n value\\n-adjusted LCOE; \\nkW = kilowatt; MWh = megawatt\\n-hour; CCGT = combined\\n-cycle gas turbine.

This definition differs from the one \\n\\nused for ﬁadva\\nnced biofuelsﬂ in US legislation, which is based on a minimum 50% lifecycle \\ngreenhouse gas reduction and which, therefore, includes sugar cane ethanol.\\n Agriculture:\\n Includes all energy used on farms, in forestry and for fishing.\\n Agriculture, forestry and other land use \\n(AFOLU)\\n emissions:\\n Includes greenhouse gas \\nemissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use. \\n Ammonia \\n(NH\\n3): Is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen. It can be used directly as a fuel in \\ndirect combustion processes, as well as in fuel cells or as a hydrogen carrier. To be a low \\nemissions fuel, ammonia must be produced from low\\n-carbon hydrogen, the nitrogen \\nseparated via the Haber process with electricity generated from low\\n-carbon sources.\\n Aviation:\\n This transport mode includes both domestic and international flights and their use \\nof aviation fuels. Domestic aviation covers flights\\n that depart and land in the same country; \\nflights for military purposes are included\\n. International aviation includes flight\\ns that land in \\na country other than the departure location.\\n Back\\n-up generation capacity:\\n Households and businesses connected to the main power grid \\nmay also have some form of back\\n-up power generation capacity that, in the event of \\ndisruption, \\ncan \\nprovide electricity. Back\\n-up generators are typically fuelled with diesel or \\ngasoline\\n. Capacity can be as little as a few kilowatts. Such capacity is distinct from mini\\n-grid \\nand off\\n-grid systems that are not connected to \\na \\nmain power grid.\\n Battery storage:\\n Energy storage technology that uses reversible chemical reactions to absorb \\nand release electricity on demand.\\n Biodiesel:\\n Diesel\\n-equivalent, processed fuel made from the transesterification (a chemical \\nprocess that converts triglycerides in oils) of vegetable oils and animal fats.\\n Bioenergy:\\n Energy content in solid, liquid and gaseous products derived from biomass \\nfeedstocks and biogas.
